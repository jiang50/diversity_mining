Our purpose and mission is to connect, protect, 
explore and inspire the world through aerospace 
innovation. We aspire to be the best in aerospace 
and an enduring global industrial champion.

Achieved $93.4 billion in revenue from record 
commercial airplane deliveries, strong services 
growth and solid performance in our defense 
business. Core operating earnings were nearly
$9 billion* with core earnings per share of $12.04*.

Increased operating cash flow to a record
$13.3 billion and maintained cash and marketable 
securities of $10 billion, providing strong liquidity.

Replaced the existing share repurchase program 
with an $18 billion authorization and increased the 
quarterly dividend by 20 percent. The dividend 
has increased more than 250 percent over the 
past five years; shareholders have received quar-
terly dividends for more than 75 years.

Delivered 763 commercial airplanes, an industry 
record, leading the world in airplane deliveries for 
the sixth consecutive year.

Delivered 170 military aircraft and four satellites, 
and had strong sales of weapons systems.

Won 912 net orders for commercial airplanes, 
raising the company’s total order backlog to 
5,864 airplanes—worth about seven years of 
production.

Maintained a solid defense, space and security 
order backlog of $50 billion, 40 percent of which 
came from international customers. New and 
follow-on business included contracts for 27
P-8 Poseidon aircraft, 36 advanced F-15 fighters 
and 268 Apache helicopters; a contract from

the Missile Defense Agency for Redesigned Kill 
Vehicle development; a design contract for the 
Ground Based Strategic Deterrent; the first KC-46 
tanker international order, from Japan; and selec-
tion to design and build seven satellites for SES.

Reached many Commercial Airplanes milestones, 
including first flight of the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10; 
delivery of the first 737 MAX 8, to Malindo Air;
a landmark agreement with flydubai for 175 
737 MAX airplanes, the largest-ever single-aisle 
jet order from a Middle East carrier.

Achieved key defense, space and security mile-
stones, including the refueling of a KC-46A 
tanker from another KC-46A; FAA certification 
of the 767-2C aircraft, verifying the fundamental 
design of the KC-46 tanker; first flight of the 
second T-X aircraft; launch of the final Tracking
and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) for NASA’s space 
communications network; and a successful 
Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system 
intercept test.

Boeing Global Services, a new business unit that 
provides cost-competitive support to commercial 
and government customers worldwide, earned 
$14.6 billion of revenue in 2017. This was driven 
by key commercial and defense wins, including a 
contract for F-15 sustainment for Qatar, an order 
for seven 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters 
from GECAS, a 787 landing gear exchange agree-
ment with All Nippon and a P-8I training agreement 
with India.

2017 in Review
In 2017, more than 140,000 dedicated Boeing
employees around the world delivered record
company financial and operational performance,
strengthened our businesses for profitable, long-term
growth, and drove additional productivity and quality
gains across the enterprise. Our strong performance
trend—underpinned by our sizeable backlog, a large
and growing aerospace and defense market, and
our positive future outlook—helped make Boeing the
Dow’s top-performing company in 2017, as measured
by stock price and total shareholder returns.

Company revenue in 2017 was $93.4 billion, fueled
by record commercial airplane deliveries, growth in
our services business, and solid defense, space and
security performance. We also won $110.2 billion in
net new orders for our market-leading and innovative
products and services, raising our companywide
backlog to $488 billion.

Core earnings per share of $12.04* for the year, also
a company record, reflected our strong operating
performance and a favorable tax reform impact of
$1.74 per share. Core operating earnings rose 64
percent over 2016 to a Boeing-record $9.0 billion*
and operating cash flow grew to an all-time high of
$13.3 billion, enabling us to return significant value to
our shareholders while investing for the future in our
people and our business.

Keeping with our balanced cash deployment strat-
egy, in 2017 we repurchased 46.1 million shares of
Boeing stock for $9.2 billion and paid $3.4 billion

in dividends. In December, the Boeing Board of
Directors signaled its continued confidence in our
financial strength and long-term outlook, authorizing
a new $18 billion share repurchase program and
increasing the quarterly dividend by 20 percent.
Over the past five years, we have raised our quarterly
dividend by more than 250 percent.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported
$56.7 billion of revenue in 2017 and led the industry in
deliveries for the sixth consecutive year with a record
763 airplanes. With net new orders for an additional
912 airplanes, we grew our commercial airplanes
backlog to a company record of 5,864 jets. This
strong order book, worth $421 billion, is equal to
approximately seven years of production at current
rates. Full-year operating margins were 9.6 percent.

The 737 family continues to exceed expectations
in the single-aisle market, with 745 net new orders
received and a company record of 529 airplanes
delivered in 2017. Our 737 backlog now stands at
more than 4,600 airplanes. In 2017, we also transi-
tioned our production system smoothly to the
737 MAX, allowing us to deliver the first 74 737 MAX 8
airplanes while increasing overall 737 production
to 47 aircraft per month. We continued to make
progress building out the MAX family, including the
start of production on the 737 MAX 7, the rollout
and first flight of the 737 MAX 9 and the launch of
the 737 MAX 10, the largest plane in the MAX family.
The MAX 9 is scheduled to enter service this year.
With more than 4,300 orders from 92 customers
worldwide, the 737 MAX is the fastest-selling airplane

growth potential.

We also extended our market and technology lead 
in the high-value twin-aisle segment with significant 
progress on the 787 and 777 programs. We contin-
ued building 787s at the highest production rate for a 
twin-aisle jet (12 airplanes per month), leading to 136 
deliveries for the year from our production facilities
in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South
Carolina. We completed rollout and first flight of the 
787-10, the third and largest Dreamliner model, and
soon will deliver the first airplane to launch customer 
Singapore Airlines. At the end of 2017, the worldwide 
operating fleet of 636 787 Dreamliners had flown
2.8 billion miles, carried 210 million passengers and 
opened more than 170 new nonstop city pairs.

Our newest twin-aisle airplane, the 777X, remains 
on track to enter service in 2020. In 2017, we began 
producing parts for the first flight-test airplane in 
our Composite Wing Center in Everett. Our current
backlog of 340 orders and commitments from seven 
global customers remains strong as interest in the 
airplane’s unsurpassed efficiency continues to grow. 
We also expect increased demand for widebody 
replacements early in the next decade.

Building on our industry-record deliveries in 2017, we 
remain on track to increase production even further 
over the next few years to more than 900 airplanes 
annually, based on previously announced rate 
increases. Our plans include raising the 737 produc-
tion rate from the current 47 airplanes per month to 
52 in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. And with 
more than 650 firm orders in our Dreamliner backlog, 
our plan to increase 787 production from 12 airplanes 
per month today to 14 in 2019 is well supported.

Production rates on the 747, 767 and 777 are set 
to continue at existing levels in 2018. Continued
improvements in the cargo market, as evidenced by 
an order for 14 additional 747-8 Freighters from UPS 
in early 2018, support our 0.5 airplane per month 
rate. Production of 2.5 767s per month is supported 
by continued demand for commercial freighters
and military aerial refueling tankers. On 777, as we 
transition to production of the 777X, we expect a 
delivery rate of roughly 3.5 per month in 2018 and 
2019. For the current-generation 777, we received 40 
net new orders in 2017, bringing the backlog to 102 
as progress continues on the 777 to 777X bridge. 

The commercial airplane market remains large and
growing, valued at $2.8 trillion over the next decade. 
Passenger traffic continues to outpace expectations
and demand for new airplanes remains high. We esti-
mate customers will buy more than 41,000 airplanes 
over the next 20 years, including approximately 9,100 
widebodies, as more people travel by air, particularly 
in the rapidly growing Asia region. This long-term 
demand forecast, coupled with healthy market 
conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid 
foundation for our planned production rates.

Boeing Defense, Space & Security achieved 
continued success in 2017, recording healthy revenue 
and margins, winning important new orders and 
logging significant program milestones, including 
progress on the KC-46 tanker. Revenues were
$21.1 billion with operating margins of 10.6 percent. 
In total, we delivered four commercial and military 
satellites, 170 military aircraft and 35,618 weapons 
systems. New orders worth $28.8 billion reinforced 
our $50 billion backlog, which includes a balanced
mix of U.S. and international customers.

In 2017, Boeing and our
employees and retirees 
invested $181 million—
plus thousands of
employee volunteer 
hours—to help enhance 
lives and communities 
where we live and work 
around the world.

We outperformed our 
goal of zero growth in 
environmental impact
from 2012 to 2017, even 
as we increased produc-
tion and expanded our 
operations globally.

2017 include:

A $3.4 billion multiyear contract for 268 AH-64E
Apache helicopters and a $3.4 billion order for
at least 27 P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the United
States, Australia and United Kingdom.
A contract to provide 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar.
Successful downselect to design the United
States’ next intercontinental ballistic missile.
FAA certification of the 767-2C aircraft, verifying
that the fundamental design of the KC-46 tanker
is safe and reliable, the inaugural flight of the
first tanker destined for the U.S. Air Force, and a
contract to build a new tanker for Japan—the first
international KC-46 customer.
A successful Ground-based Midcourse Defense
(GMD) system intercept test and the ahead-
of-schedule emplacement of the 44th GMD
interceptor at Ft. Greely, Alaska.

We also extended our leadership in the increasingly
competitive space market with several achievements:

Successful completion of CST-100 Starliner drop
tests and design certification review.
Welding of the five hardware structures that form
Space Launch System’s 212-foot-tall (64.6 m) core
stage—the backbone of the rocket that will carry
the first humans to Mars.
Launch of seven satellites and the X-37B reusable,
autonomous spacecraft.
Eight successful launches by our United Launch
Alliance joint venture.
A NASA contract to develop a deep-space habita-
tion concept.

While our global defense and space customers
continue to balance constrained budgets and rapidly
evolving threats, we are seeing solid demand for
our products and services in a market valued at
$2.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Our ongoing
pursuit of improved affordability and productivity, as
well as strong performance across our core business
areas—weapons, fixed-wing strike and integrated
missile systems—have us well positioned to fund our
future. This foundational work is allowing us to invest
in growth markets, such as commercial derivatives,
rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space explo-
ration and autonomous systems, while competing
for exciting new programs including the T-X trainer,
MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueling aircraft and the
Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.

In July 2017, our third major business unit, Boeing
Global Services, started operations to provide
more agile, cost-effective and streamlined after-
market support and services, help address our
customers’ increased focus on aircraft readiness and
value-based life-cycle solutions, and secure a larger
share of the 10-year, $2.6 trillion—and growing—
commercial and government services market.
Because we produce roughly half of the world’s com-
mercial and defense fleets, and aircraft service life is
increasing, aerospace services represents one of our
biggest growth opportunities for the future.

Boeing Global Services got off to a strong start in
2017 with revenue of $14.6 billion and operating
margins of 15.4 percent, reflecting solid execution
and portfolio diversity. Our services backlog stands
at $17.2 billion. Year-on-year growth of 5 percent
outpaced the average services market growth rate
of 3.5 percent, an outcome we strive to repeat in the
coming years as we expand our services offerings
and grow market share.

Our services expertise, the global reach of our busi-
ness and our strong customer partnerships have us
well positioned to compete and win for the long-term
in areas such as spare parts; maintenance, modifica-
tions and upgrades; training; and, increasingly, digital
solutions, which generated approximately $1 billion in
revenue in 2017.

Early key wins include:

An F-15 sustainment contract for Qatar.
An order for seven 737-800 Boeing Converted
Freighters for GECAS.
A 787 landing gear exchange agreement with
All Nippon Airways.
A P-8I training agreement with India.

Accelerating Our Pace of Progress
In 2017, driven in part by a global business environ-
ment that is growing more competitive by the day,
we promoted a productive sense of urgency at all
levels of the company to accelerate the pace of our
innovation.

Succeeding in rapidly changing global markets requires
that we think and do things differently. It demands
change, a willingness to embrace it and the agility to
both drive and respond to external forces. The com-
petition is not standing still, and neither are we.

Over the past year, we made several strategic invest-
ments to better position ourselves for future markets
and growth. We stood up Boeing Global Services to
expand our share of the aerospace services market.

and space products and services such as the
787-10 and 777X, the KC-46 tanker and T-X trainer
aircraft, and the CST-100 Starliner and Space Launch
System. We took steps to strengthen our capabilities
in areas such as data analytics, avionics, actuation
and additive manufacturing—high-value work that
benefits from our internal expertise and global scale.
We launched our Boeing HorizonX innovation cell
and formed partnerships with several companies
whose technology can change the competitive
landscape. We acquired Aurora Flight Sciences to
bolster our autonomous-flight portfolio.

As we shape our business for a second century of
aerospace innovation, we continue to make meaning-
ful progress toward building a zero-injury workplace,
achieving world-class quality and creating the kind
of culture that breaks down organizational barriers,
eliminates bureaucracy and unleashes the full capa-
bilities of our people.

Looking ahead to 2018 and beyond, we remain
focused on winning through innovation, driving growth
and productivity and extending our position as the
world’s leading aerospace company—all while deliv-
ering the best value to our customers, employees
and shareholders.

Our Enduring Values
The importance of our purpose and mission demands
that we work with the utmost integrity and excellence
and embrace the enduring values that define who we
are today and the company we aspire to be tomorrow.
These core values—integrity, quality, safety, diversity
and inclusion, trust and respect, corporate citizenship
and stakeholder success—remind us all that how we
do our work is every bit as important as the work itself.

Living these values also means being best-in-class in
community and environmental stewardship.

In 2017, Boeing and its employees and retirees
contributed a total of $181 million—in addition to
time and talent—to help strengthen communities
worldwide. We also revamped our approach to
corporate citizenship with the launch of Boeing
Global Engagement. This new approach takes a
companywide, strategic view of our investments and
employee engagement activities by focusing on our
commitment to science, technology, engineering and
math education as well as military veterans—more
than 20,000 of whom we are proud to call Boeing
teammates. This renewed focus is helping us deepen
relationships and inspire positive, lasting change in
the places we call home.

Additionally, every day, Boeing employees advance
efforts to improve the environmental efficiency and
performance of our products and services, reduce
emissions and conserve water and resources. To
date, we have tested nearly 70 technologies on our
ecoDemonstrator program with another 30 planned
in 2018. We also further collaborated with outside
experts to help identify and deliver stormwater man-
agement and water-quality improvements. Finally,
even as aircraft production hits record levels, our goal
remains zero growth in greenhouse gas emissions,
water use, hazardous waste (normalized to revenue)
and solid waste sent to landfills.

Achieving Our Bold Aspiration
Boeing is stronger, more innovative and more focused
than ever in our mission to connect, protect, explore
and inspire the world. I believe we have the industry’s
best team, the right products, services and strategies,
and a compelling vision that defines who we are as
a company, where we are headed and how we are
going to win.

As encouraging as our performance was in 2017,
I am even more excited about what lies ahead—
countless opportunities to build upon our storied
legacy, exceed customer and stakeholder expecta-
tions and claim Boeing’s position among the world’s
best companies, regardless of industry.

We are intensely focused on delivering consistently
on our customer commitments and commercial,
defense and space development programs, capturing
new business and winning key campaigns, growing
our new integrated services business, pursuing
breakthrough technologies that will strengthen our
innovation engine, and further investing in our people.

Since my early days as an engineering intern at
Boeing more than 30 years ago, I have viewed this
great company with a sense of wonder—in the prod-
ucts we design, build and support, in the important
mission we serve and in the talented, passionate
people around the world who I now have the honor
of leading. Our second century is off to a fast start,
and I look forward to you joining us on the incredible
journey that awaits.

In 2017, we won $110.2 billion in net 
orders. All three business units 
increased their backlogs, with the 
company backlog rising to $488 billion, 
positioning Boeing to continue to 
achieve strong growth and performance 
for many years.

We delivered an industry-record
763 commercial airplanes, maintaining 
our market share lead for the sixth 
consecutive year.

We remain highly confident in our 
commercial market outlook, which 
forecasts demand for about 41,000 
new airplanes over the next 20 years. 

Across our defense, space and security 
portfolio, we provide innovative, reliable 
and affordable solutions, giving Boeing 
a strong foundation from which to grow 
its share of a market expected to be 
worth $2.2 trillion over the next decade. 

With the successful launch of our 
services business in 2017, we continue 
to win new business in a market 
expected to be valued at $2.6 trillion 
over the next 10 years.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

Revenues in 2017 were $93.4 billion,
driven by record commercial deliveries, 
continued growth in services, and solid 
performance in our defense, space
and security business.

Record core earnings per share for 
2017 reflected strong operating 
performance across the company 
and favorable tax reform impact.†

Cash generation continued to be 
robust, with operating cash flow for the 
year a record at $13.3 billion largely 
driven by strong operating performance. 
This supported a 20 percent increase 
to our dividend and a new $18 billion 
share repurchase authorization.

* Total backlog includes contractual and
unobligated backlog. See page 23 of the 
Form 10-K.
† Non-GAAP measure. See page 119.

integrated logistics,
including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance,
modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and
maintenance training. Major defense programs supported include the C-17 Globemaster III, F-15 Strike
Eagle, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and AH-64 Apache for domestic and international customers.

Boeing Capital Segment

BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their
Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC’s portfolio consists of equipment under
operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and
investments.

Financial and Other Business Information

See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our
products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also
license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in
our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others
to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research,
development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual
property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights
in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our
business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or
termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.

Non-U.S. Revenues

See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues.

Research and Development

Research and development (R&D) expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related
test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military,
advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. R&D expenditures are expensed
as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts.

Our total research and development expense, net amounted to $3.2 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion in
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products
and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-
sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were $288 million, $311 million
and $286 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Competition

jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face
The commercial
aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus,
Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving
our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane
manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products.

BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop
Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S.
companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S.
market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In
addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific
customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2018.

The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of
the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those
markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the
life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics,
maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate
operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2018, and intends to grow market
share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.

Regulatory Matters

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government
agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities
exist in our non-U.S. markets.

Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our
government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified
performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience,
we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or
cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S.

between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted
from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the
default.

Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA
regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair
procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness,
installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national
aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation
Authorities.

Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating
to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of
hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of
environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws
and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with
environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These
costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible
that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent
clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are
discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.

A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental
laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state
environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of
remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to
fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory
framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information
relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and
procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment,
exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying
currency, political and economic risks.

Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies

We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our
suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are
aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and
composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw
materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product
equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies.

Suppliers

We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors
to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs.
While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated
with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could
adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability

and are subject to unique risks.

Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services.
The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo
traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political
stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced
by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government
relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics
and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive
and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In
addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the
United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the
airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in
fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual
orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a
reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of
aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or
customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.

We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could
subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation
rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In
order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing
generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity
and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these
escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can
fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact
revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make
no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or
purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or
financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce
our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.

Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production
system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new
derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.

The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration
with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners,
and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards.
the
introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, and 777X, involves increased
risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result,
our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain,
as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.

In addition,

We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in
order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates
on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing
development and production of the 787-10 and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities
to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs,

If
production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create
significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us
at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/
or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.

Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft
programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either
of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production
system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components,
failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications,
could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed
deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs.

If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional
costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our
performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be
costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft
programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result
in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.

Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could
negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related
programs with the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are
very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S.
foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation
such as authorization and appropriations bills.

In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels,
and additional reductions may be forthcoming. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act) established limits
on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012
and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall
levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue
to be subject to pressure.

In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for
the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework
described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations committees included funding for Boeing’s
major programs, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, KC-46A Tanker and P-8 programs, in
the final FY2017 appropriation and in their FY2018 bills, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets
in FY2018 and beyond will affect Boeing’s programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by
sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations
process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of
these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position
and/or cash flows.

In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending
levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-
cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully
to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer,
our revenues and market share would be further impacted.

are subject to unique risks.

In 2017, 31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign
military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is
subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.

Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those
regulations could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements,
could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our
BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could
be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail
to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential
future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating
results.

The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government
contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice
and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our
U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations
process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other
reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S.
government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”
rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or
modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse
effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.

We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we
determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the
Defense ContractAuditAgency and the Defense Contract ManagementAgency, routinely audit government
contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our
internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a
specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded.
Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties
and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal
activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment
from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of
impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.

We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2017 revenues
from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements,
cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if
we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price,
we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during
2017, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $471 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract,
primarily driven by additional costs attributable to certification and incorporating changes into low rate
initial production (LRIP) aircraft. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of
estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain
price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant

In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule
and performance.

Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production
contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or
quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete,
which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of
significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A
Tanker, and commercial and military satellites.

We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of their 2017 revenues
from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex
design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that
are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial
risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical
performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD, Proprietary
and SLS programs.

We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.

Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit
incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid
in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite
does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit
incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the
satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making
in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant
charges.

Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent
on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the
availability of raw materials and other components.

We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and
produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to
perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or
subcontractors experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may
be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of
the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable
or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely
fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service
disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as
geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating
costs.

We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could
adversely affect our future financial results.

Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and

Due to the size and nature of many of
our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and
subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the
contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits,
material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are
considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for
us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating
costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and
anticipated awards.

With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including
overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated
and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of
the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term
production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make
reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program
accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the
period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales
prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the
total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from
prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and
rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance,
customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact
these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future
financial performance.

Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially
different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying
circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may
adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies
for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –
Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting” on pages 41 – 43 and Note 1 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52 – 64 of this Form 10-K.

Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future
contracts and sales.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have
more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in
some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S.
aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of
defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-
term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. will intensify competition for many of our BDS
products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S.
competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and
cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not
result in reduced revenues and market share.

doing business in other countries.

In 2017, non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 55% of our revenues.
We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the
foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:

•
•

•
•

•
•

•
•

•
•

•

changes in regulatory requirements;
U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program
funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;
fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;
volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national
priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;
the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability
of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;
imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and
other trade restrictions;
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S.
companies abroad; and
unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international
tensions and conflicts.

While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely
affect our operations in the future.

Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact
our business.

We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data
and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement
mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While
these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems,
certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses
and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for
certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the
unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally
identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business
is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our
financial position and results of operations.

We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management
resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the
results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future
lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we

other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and
investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.
government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings,
our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result
in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results
of operations.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers
and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in
distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft
product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than
investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets
experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their
expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that
are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows
and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at
competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.

We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our airplane financing commitments totaled $10,221 million and $14,847
million. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other
business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to
incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for
debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our
financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely
affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic
alliances or divestitures.

As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and
strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities
depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance
of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other
personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by
unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses
related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance
and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations
or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and
processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We
also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements,
following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial
results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance
for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government.
The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft
technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic
management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these
products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland
Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities.
The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or
liabilities.

Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase
our costs and expenses.

Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology
or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health
crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and
services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper
use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or
have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.

Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to
work stoppages.

Approximately 52,000 employees, which constitute 37% of our total workforce, were union represented
as of December 31, 2017. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial
aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future,
which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with
10 U.S. labor organizations and 7 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet
the unions’ requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility
in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability
in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could
strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our
operations.

Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our
earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse
impacts in future periods.

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension
contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions
depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We
estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items.
Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our
annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. government
contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards
which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our
employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents.
Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including

For a discussion regarding how our financial statements
can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see “Management's
Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-Pension Plans” on page 43 of this Form 10-K.
Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related,
the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock
we would contribute to our plans.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to
environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of
hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and
civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were
to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject
to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations
or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs
due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities.
In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could
result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Overview

We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of
commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems
and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide
commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal
operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an
extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.

Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes
(BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by
Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial
earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the
products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve
efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader
in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value
to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications,
security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our
BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding
our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and
productivity. BGS provides support for commercial, defense and space customers through innovative,
comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and service solutions. Our strategy also benefits us as the
cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and
provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

Revenues in 2017 decreased by $1,179 million or 1% compared with 2016. BCA revenues decreased by
$1,283 million or 2% primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the
impact of higher single aisle deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,506 million primarily due to fewer
C-17 deliveries, lower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache
and F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs. The decreases at
BCA and BDS were partially offset by higher unallocated revenue and higher BGS revenue, primarily due
to higher commercial parts revenue.

Revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,543 million or 2% compared with 2015. BCA revenues decreased by
$1,387 million or 2% due fewer deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,145 million or 5% primarily due
to lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs, fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial
Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue
on several modifications and upgrades programs. The decreases at BCA and BDS were partially offset
by higher BGS revenue, primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue and government services
revenue.

The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect the
timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to
customers.

earnings at BCA and BDS, and higher unallocated pension income, which more than offset other
unallocated items and eliminations. BCA's 2017 earnings increased by $3,437 million primarily reflecting
lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting
favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. In 2016, BCA recorded
reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test
aircraft inventory costs to research and development expense.

BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to
lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact
of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apache delivery mix.

Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings
at BCA, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). BCA
earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787
flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and
KC-46ATanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter
of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable.
The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven
by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2017,
we recorded charges of $471 million, of which $378 million was recorded at BCA and $93 million at BDS.
During 2016, we recorded charges of $1,128 million: $772 million at BCA and $356 million at BDS. During
2015, we recorded charges of $835 million: $513 million at BCA and $322 million at BDS. During 2016
and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million.

Core operating earnings for 2017 increased by $3,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower
reach forward losses and the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft in 2016.

Core operating earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,227 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the
reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A
Tanker programs described above.

primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.

Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $117 million in 2017 and increased by $20 million
in 2016 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense
allocations.

Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $312 million, $523 million and $2,786 million in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table:

The decreases in net periodic pension benefit costs of $211 million in 2017 and of $2,263 million in 2016
are primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution
retirement savings plans. The decrease in 2016 costs is also due to lower amortization of actuarial losses
which reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to
4.2%.

A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and
the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from
operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21.

Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:

The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2017 was a benefit of $1,120 million compared
with $217 million in 2016. The higher unallocated pension benefit recognized in earnings in 2017 primarily
reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years. The unallocated pension
costs recognized in earnings in 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with expense of $421 million
in 2015. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the
U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period.

Other income, net increased by $89 million and $53 million in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to higher gains
from foreign exchange and interest income.

Interest and debt expense increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest and
increased by $31 million in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances.

Our effective income tax rates were 18.4%, 12.1% and 27.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, reduced the 2017
effective tax rate by 10.5% and resulted in incremental tax benefits of $1,051 million, primarily related to
the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate
from 35% to 21%. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the 2015 rate primarily due to lower pre-tax
income in 2016 and discrete tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to
tax basis adjustments and the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit.

For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)

Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies,
labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses
program accounting to account for cost of sales, BDS predominantly uses contract accounting and BGS
uses contract accounting for defense contracts. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each
commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer
deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under
contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost
of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.

The following table summarizes cost of sales:

Cost of sales in 2017 decreased by $4,724 million, or 6%, compared with 2016, primarily due to lower
reach-forward losses, delivery model mix at BCA and improved performance at BCA and BDS.

Cost of sales in 2016 decreased by $1,298 million, or 2%, compared with 2015, primarily due to lower
volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at BCA.

Research and development expense in 2017 decreased by $1,448 million compared with 2016 primarily
due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related
to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX, 787-10, and 777X.

Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive
contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The
increase in contractual backlog during 2017 was primarily due to orders and funding in excess of deliveries.
The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders.

Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has
not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to contract
awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts.

Additional Considerations

KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop,
manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative
of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a
fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems
integration. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the
third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two
LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional

The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft
and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179
aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The EMD contract is currently in
the certification and flight testing phases and we expect 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in 2018.

During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128 million and $835 million related to the
EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded further reach-forward losses of $471 million
primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into
LRIP aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward
losses or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, delays in
certification and/or flight testing.

Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through
the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30,
2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through
September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum
of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than
$10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements
with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain
financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns
involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with
the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources.

Commercial Airplanes

Business Environment and Trends

Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, has returned to the
long-term average of approximately 3%. Passenger traffic in 2017 is estimated to grow by more than 7%,
exceeding the long-term trend of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions,
there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Asia
Pacific regions and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in
passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth, building on the recovery that started in 2016, is expected to
exceed 9% in 2017, driven by strong trade and industrial production in all regions.

Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus
on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging
of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets
to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2017 are expected to approximate $35 billion, consistent
with 2016.

The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air
travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization,
and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year
forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo
traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we
project a $6.1 trillion market for approximately 41,030 new airplanes over the next 20 years.

The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market
shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental
regulations.

competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to
continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in
continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are
essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.

Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-
term investment returns. Approximately 91% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is
with non-U.S. airlines.

We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer
competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government
support,Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional
jet makers Embraer and Bombardier continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable
airplanes, including Embraer’s E-195 in the regional jet market and Bombardier’s C Series in the 100-150
seat transcontinental market. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing
commercial
jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-
provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks
associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without
commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered
for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency,
which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This
market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we
expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which
enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed
by unfair subsidization of competitors.

Earnings From Operations

Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,437 million compared with 2016. The increase in earnings
and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development
costs and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of
lower revenues.

Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million compared with 2015. The decrease in
earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of $1,395
million, delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million compared with
$885 million in 2015. Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory
to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft
and higher planned spending related to the 777X program.

Reach-forward losses of $378 million, $772 million and $513 million were recorded related to the KC-46A
Tanker in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses
on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million.

Backlog

Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and
the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer
controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors,
shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be
satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly
certain. Firm backlog excludes options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that
may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual
relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until
canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed
to with customers.

BCA total backlog was $421,345 million, $413,036 million and $429,346 million at December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries.
The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders.

produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity
is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and
anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual
airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account
several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent
from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.

The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units
under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In
developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.

The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of
December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries
plus undelivered firm orders.

Program Highlights

737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2017 due to the
program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently
producing at a rate of 47 per month and plan to increase to 52 per month in 2018. We plan to further
increase the rate to 57 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017 and announced
the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017.

747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2017, we received firm orders and commitments for 15 aircraft
and we increased the program accounting quantity by 15 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now
includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2021. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft
per month, having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016 and 2015, we recorded
reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million as lower than expected demand for large
commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic

continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to
end production of the 747.

767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during the third quarter
of 2017 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The
767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. The combined tanker and
commercial production rate increased from 2 per month to 2.5 per month in the third quarter of 2017.

777 Program We implemented a planned production rate decrease from 8.3 per month to 7 per month
during the first quarter of 2017. We further reduced the rate to 5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. In
the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines
and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined
in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.

787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the third quarter
of 2017 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We
are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. First delivery
of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018.

Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to
facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities
and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane.
They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information
services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as
incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total consolidated costs of products and services.

Additional Considerations
The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive
coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners.
Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and
regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and
derivatives, such as the 787-10 and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development,
production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance
and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant
risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is
determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting

changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving
completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new
production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions,
flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and
status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the
cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the
technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may
become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination
provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

Defense, Space & Security

Business Environment and Trends

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

In November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018),
which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget topline higher than the administration’s budget request from May.
While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the House and Senate
appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the
administration’s request. On February 9, 2018, Congress passed a fifth Continuing Resolution that
maintains current funding levels through March 23, 2018 and includes increases to the Budget Control
Act caps for defense and non-defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the Budget Control
Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a
result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress
acts to repeal or suspend this law.

Funding timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus
spending bill before the expiration of the current Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could
result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts
or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD, the
Department of Transportation, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our
ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.

In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD
and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes
could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these
impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or
cash flows.

Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and
evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects
that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given
the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2017, 40% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-US customers.

Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production
contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-
to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results.
In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual
follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period
comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of
comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

BDS revenues in 2017 decreased by $1,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to fewer C-17
deliveries, lower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and
F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs.

BDS revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,145 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower milestone
revenue on government satellite programs, fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial Crew revenue, as
well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on several
modifications and upgrades programs.

BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to
lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact
of fewer C-17 deliveries andApache delivery mix. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative
catch-up adjustments which were $541 million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower
charges.

BDS earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $346 million compared with 2015, primarily due to
lower earnings on the Commercial Crew program, driven by a charge of $162 million during the third
quarter of 2016, as well as lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. Lower earnings include
the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $441 million higher than
2015, primarily due to Commercial Crew charges in 2016 and the absence of favorable F-15 program
adjustments recorded in 2015.

BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $183 million, $249 million and $202 million
primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $93 million,
$356 million and $322 million.

Backlog

Total backlog of $49,577 million at December 31, 2017 increased by 11% from December 31, 2016, primarily
due to current year contract awards for the F-15 and Apache programs, partially offset by revenue
recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.

Total backlog of $44,825 million at December 31, 2016 decreased by 4% reflecting revenue recognized
on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for satellite, P-8,
weapons, Apache and CH-47 Chinook programs.

Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical
challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the
associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost,
schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based
Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.

Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have
highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience
schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce
our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our
financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates
incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates
financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be
extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or
other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated
costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs
include KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, and commercial and military satellites.

KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the USAF KC-46A Tanker program on page 23.

Global Services

Business Environment and Trends

The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services;
maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services.
We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually.

As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket
services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using
data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and
efficiency.Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory,
frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.

Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the
utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual
market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade,
we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers,
to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of
the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased
demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.

BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty
described on page 29, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new
programs or competitions.

Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international
competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these
pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital
to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

BGS revenues in 2017 increased by $714 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher commercial
parts revenue.

BGS revenues in 2016 increased by $632 million compared with 2015 primarily due to higher commercial
parts revenues and government services revenue.

Earnings From Operations

BGS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $79 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher
revenues, partially offset by commercial services mix. Net
favorable cumulative contract catch-up
adjustments were $9 million lower in 2017 than in 2016.

BGS earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $342 million compared with 2015 primarily due to
higher revenues and favorable mix of commercial parts and government services. Net favorable cumulative
contract catch-up adjustments were $12 million higher in 2016 than in 2015.

Backlog

BGS total backlog of $17,223 million at December 31, 2017 increased by 10% from December 31, 2016,
primarily due to current year contract awards including F-15, C-17, and Apache support programs.

BGS total backlog of $15,631 million at December 31, 2016 increased by 20% from December 31, 2015
primarily due to current year contract awards including the C-17 support program.

Boeing Capital

Business Environment and Trends

BCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 totaled $3,006 million. A
substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-
grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types,
most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.

BCC provided customer financing of $480 million and $1,376 million during 2017 and 2016. While we may
be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2018 and/or provide refinancing for existing
bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally
diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase
further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not,
approve new financing transactions.

Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of
service. Approximately 2,000 western-built commercial jet aircraft (8.3% of current world fleet) were parked
at the end of 2017, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked
aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2016 and 2015, 8.8% and
9.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant
numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest
income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2017 were consistent
with 2016.

BCC’s revenues in 2016 decreased by $115 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower lease
income, and lower end of lease settlement payments.

Earnings From Operations

BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses,
asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings
from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation
expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset impairment
expense which more than offset lower revenues.

BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 decreased from December 31,
2016, primarily due to $1,434 million of asset sales, note payoffs, and portfolio run-off, partially offset by
new volume.

Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $25 million are scheduled to be returned
off lease during 2018. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.

BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other,
in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality
or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 billion during 2017, compared
with $10.5 billion during 2016 and $9.4 billion in 2015. The increase of $2.8 billion in 2017 was primarily
driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases. The increase of $1.1 billion in 2016
was primarily due to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787.Advances
and progress billings increased by $4.6 billion in 2017, decreased by $1.9 billion in 2016 and increased
by $0.4 billion in 2015. During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included 14.4
million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash.
Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2016 and 2015.

Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion, $3.4
billion and $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion in 2017, down from $2.6 billion in 2016
and $2.5 billion in 2015. We expect capital expenditures in 2018 to be higher than 2017. Net proceeds
from investments was insignificant in 2017. Net contributions to investments were $0.5 billion in 2016
compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.6 billion in 2015.

Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017, an increase of $1.8
billion compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. During
2017, our net borrowings were $1.1 billion compared with minimal net repayments in 2016. Cash used by
financing activities was $9.6 billion during 2016, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with 2015, primarily
due to lower net borrowings and higher dividend payments and share repurchases.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 the recorded balance of debt was $11.1 billion and $10.0 billion of which
$1.3 billion and $0.4 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 this included
$2.5 billion and $2.9 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.9 billion and $0.1 billion were classified
as short-term.

During 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 46.1 million and 55.1 million shares totaling $9.2 billion and $7.0
billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2017 and 2016, we had 0.7 million shares
transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2017, the amount available under
the share repurchase plan, announced on December 11, 2017, totaled $18 billion.

Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit
ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper

At December 31, 2017, commercial paper
borrowings totaling $600 million were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit
agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused
borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily
serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.

Financing commitments totaled $10.2 billion and $14.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We
anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we
continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we
have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be
no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition,
many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United
States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized
in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S.
Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank
will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million.As a result, we may fund additional
commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.

In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial
aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other
business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper
or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy
existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility
to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year.
However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our
commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our pension plans were $16.4 billion and $20.1 billion underfunded as
measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are
more than 100% funded at December 31, 2017 with minimal required contributions in 2018. During 2017,
we contributed shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash.
We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2018. We may be required to make higher
contributions to our pension plans in future years.

At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The
most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as
a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation
on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we
continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.

(1) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2017, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions
of $1,736 million, was $1,634 million. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of
our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional
discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated
future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.

Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or
services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum,
variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations
include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position.

Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase
obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for
inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment,
customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most
significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant
inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery
timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require
suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production
schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended
production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments
is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from
customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are
also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement
contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate
of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.

Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase
obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts
payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.

with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills
transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or
services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct
work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other
forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties
(such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties
could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2017, we incurred
no such penalties. As of December 31, 2017, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements
totaling $17.9 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial
participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such
a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our
requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.

Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft
on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect
to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience,
we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments.
However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically
required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not,
provide new financing support. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Obligations

We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the
following:

Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies
are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have
recorded a liability of $524 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information, see Note 11 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of
these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial
information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage
investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on
any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share
exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to
business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance
with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension
costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in
accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial
assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts.
Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally
based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2017 was a benefit
of $1,120 million compared with a benefit of $217 million in 2016 and an expense of $421 million in 2015.
The higher 2017 benefit reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years.
The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S.
GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements
and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s
Discussion and Analysis on pages 20 and 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings
per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management
believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance
as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market
factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Contract Accounting

Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by BDS and for
defense contracts at BGS. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales
and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For
each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales
percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.

Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs
through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based
on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options,
change orders,
incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price
adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with
the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service
plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed
in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated
purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections.
Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and
subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor
agreements.

Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes
in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception
to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in
revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward
loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017 net
favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased
Earnings from operations by $14 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net unfavorable
cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings
from operations by $912 million and $224 million.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially
different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying
circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or
circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined
gross margin for all contracts in BDS and defense contracts at BGS for all of 2017 had been estimated to
be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately
$280 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss
position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.

Program Accounting

Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs
for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units
(accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery
under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the
ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated
contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated
cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes
delivered and accepted by the customer.

benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling
and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program
takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as
firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program
sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting
quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for
all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is
updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers,
historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence
these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/
or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or
deflationary trends.

To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated
on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated
costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity,
a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the
accounting quantity. For example, in 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million
and $885 million on the 747 program. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is
reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.

The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over
the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the
beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring
costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial
margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the
estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory
as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are
expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit
cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements
are realized.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible
that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross
margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been
estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s
operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins
for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $567 million impact on operating earnings.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments

We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment
process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-
specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely
than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the
two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations
where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair
value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step
is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated,
based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the
fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

Forecasts of future cash
flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm
orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions.
Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.

The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization
plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also
affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.

We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2017 and determined that there is no impairment
of goodwill. As a result of the change in our reportable segments, as described in Note 21, we reallocated
goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We evaluated goodwill for
impairment at July 1, 2017 and determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017, we
estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value.
Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of
certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future
periods.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to
the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these
intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash
flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted
cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would
not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Pension Plans

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and
the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual
measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several
assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes
in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future
annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.

The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis
point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2017.

Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease
or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or
decreased 2017 net periodic pension expense by $148 million. We expect 2018 net periodic pension cost
to decrease by approximately $44 million and the portion recognized in earnings before income taxes to
decrease by approximately $512 million primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations,
and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt
obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material
gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.As of December
31, 2017, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax
earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have
the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk
is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments
to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk
associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to
our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. At December 31, 2017, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio
of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $289 million.
Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such
unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the
remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency
contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015

(Dollars in millions, except per share data)

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of
The Boeing Company (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These statements
include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to
be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As
described in Note 21, effective July 1, 2017, we now operate in four reportable segments: Commercial
Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC).
Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and
estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant
estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a
material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Operating Cycle

For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or
program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year.

Revenue and Related Cost Recognition

Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities
predominantly by BDS and for defense contracts at BGS. The majority of these activities are performed
under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract
accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting
in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as
cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue
recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision
for the entire loss on the contract is recognized.

Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized
using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of
the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract’s percent complete. Net cumulative catch-
up adjustments to prior years’earnings, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts were as follows:

Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations
Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS

2017
$14
$0.02

2016
($912)
($1.25)

2015
($224)
($0.23)

Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2017 included reach-forward losses
of $471, $1,128 and $835 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2017, 2016 and 2015.

profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single
customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed
concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned
uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract
or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that
would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract.

Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price
contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which
sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which
we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The
FederalAcquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing
contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are
achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over
the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are
recorded when awarded.

Program Accounting Our Commercial Airplanes segment uses program accounting to account for cost
of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery
under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under
program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and
warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or
contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be
produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts.
The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable
estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of
sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced
and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced,
and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs,
and routine warranty costs for the total program.

We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the
customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation
formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by
applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales
recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost
of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where
the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current
period. Reductions to a reach-forward loss are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity,
whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. See Note 11.

Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration
of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services
are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in
accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed
to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.

Spare Parts Revenue We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost
of sales is recorded at average cost.

Service Revenue Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S.
government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities

travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, military and commercial
aircraft training contracts, fleet care, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft.
Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and
recognized as services are rendered.

Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance
leases, operating leases, and notes receivable.

Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset
is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased
equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the
life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are
reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the
disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates.
Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period
in which the declines occur.

For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and
depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using
the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted
changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.

For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct
costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the
note.

Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance
pool for workers’ compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize
any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $141, $147 and $136 during 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance
pool were $144, $139 and $132 during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues and costs are
presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fleet Support

We provide assistance and support to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all
our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services
include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering support, and technical data and
documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training,
manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life.
Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and
operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data,
and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves
our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests.
The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.

Research and Development

Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as
bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred

Costs that are incurred
pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized,
consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements
that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts
funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than
as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $288, $311
and $286 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation

We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares,
we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For
awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the
fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite
service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.

Income Taxes

Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings
before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect
of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income
and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax
purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax
positions.

The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial
statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We
record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement
purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our
assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the
determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax
expense.

Postretirement Plans

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and
the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement
benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and
qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally
based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on
the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is
determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant
of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for
medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not
recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and
reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual
experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If
actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize
them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and
postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is
probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or
accumulated.

Environmental Remediation

We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for
discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on
in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for
remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from
other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense
identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best
estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and
monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the
timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation
costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for
recovery is deemed probable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits,
and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate
our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative
balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to
Accounts payable were $116 and $77 at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Inventories

Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering,
production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe
benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of
estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal
event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in
the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and
contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one
year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to
manufacturing process reengineering.

Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances.
Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the
estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are
experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program
require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because
of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered
when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries
is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments
for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future.As parts are received, supplier advances
are amortized to work in process.

estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the
estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The
determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program
reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When
estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is
recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.

Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at
cost not in excess of net realizable value. See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our
valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable
value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired
inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production
usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost
of products in the period the impairment occurs.

Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other
consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early
issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under
contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we
believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales
consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written
off in the current period.

We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported
in Advances and billings in excess of related costs.

Precontract Costs

We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we
determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs
we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are
included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no
longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less
accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new
buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20
years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150%
declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use
software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. We
periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets,
including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived
assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable
based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference
between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably
estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration
obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.

We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and
asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to
insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these
obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Aliability for these obligations
will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement
becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s fair value. In addition, there may be
conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g., asbestos may exist in certain
buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these
obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for
impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than
not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.

We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment
process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the
carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment
process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step
impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related
operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to
compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part
on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value
below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test
these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted
cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of
discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.

Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer
base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate
the potential
finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer
recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment
is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.

Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate
debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses
are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.
Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly.

The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist
if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%.

We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether
the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are
integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss
from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any
impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating
investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from
non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments
or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless
of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of
market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized
asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in
earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable
to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the
hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings
immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing
objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting
purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative
instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these
aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment,
the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately.

Aircraft Valuation

Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In
conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered
into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a
specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase
commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price,
generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent
upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an
agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale

Our historical
experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.

Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:

(1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive
agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such
agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or

(2) charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur
subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the
used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued
liabilities.

The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition,
market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process
uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before
the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities
to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could
potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment
costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies
significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis,
we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into
a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft,
adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.

Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of
cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability,
aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer
financing.

Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-
type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are
established as necessary.

We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held
for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the
related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance
leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining
the allowance for losses on receivables.

We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value
publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain
circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually
when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered
by outside publications.

Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for
impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the
carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow,
including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the
expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be
held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic

We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to
sell.

When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded
is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.

Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential
impairment of
customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of
probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of
receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that
we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable
agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability
include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings
for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying
value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize.

We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding
receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the
applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the
carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated
fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable
cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average
remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for
each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information
obtained directly from our customers.

We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific
collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above.
Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be
insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements
would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which
the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.

Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating
categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness
of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ
from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or
decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.

Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance
to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our
Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four-year standard
warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured
to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at
completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct
fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties
issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are
included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two-
year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by
us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the

The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date
reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times
the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major
warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues
are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.

We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions
for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees
as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational
characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified
performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated
payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements
that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied
equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are
included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft.
These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs’ estimate at
completion.

Supplier Penalties

We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier
penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate
accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.

Guarantees

We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is
equal to the cash premium received at the guarantee’s inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is
equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s
default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future
period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a
probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the
guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount.

Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases
as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged.
The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new
rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We plan to adopt the new lease standard in 2019 and
do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We are adopting ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) in the first quarter
of 2018 using the retrospective transition method which will require 2016 and 2017 financial statements
to be restated. The new standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services
are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires expanded disclosures
regarding revenue and contracts with customers.

are made or based on the attainment of performance milestones will recognize revenue under the new
standard over time as costs are incurred. Certain military derivative aircraft contracts included in our BCA
segment will also recognize revenue as costs are incurred. The new standard will not change the total
amount of revenue recognized on these contracts, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is
recognized. In addition, the timing of cost of sales recognition for these contracts will be accelerated,
resulting in a decrease in Inventories from long-term contracts in progress.

The new standard will not affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial
airplane contracts. We will continue to recognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the
customer accepts delivery of the airplane.

Because revenue will be recognized under the new standard as costs are incurred for most of our defense
and military derivative airplane contracts, approximately $10,000 of revenues and $1,300 of associated
operating earnings will be accelerated into years ending prior to January 1, 2016. The restatement will
result in a cumulative adjustment to increase retained earnings by $900 effective January 1, 2016. Restated
income statements for 2016 and 2017 are shown below.

We are also adopting ASU No. 2017-07,Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the
Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost in the first quarter
of 2018. The standard requires non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented
in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method which will require us to restate 2016
and 2017 in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, only service costs may be allocated to production costs
and capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018. Adoption in the first quarter
of 2018 is expected to result in a reclassification of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit
cost of $6 in 2017 and $478 in 2016 from Earnings from Operations to Other income/(loss), net. We applied
a practical expedient as the estimation basis for this reclassification. Adoption of the new pension standard
will not affect previously reported financial position, earnings per share, or cash flows.

In addition to the income statement changes described above, adoption of ASC Topic 606 is expected to
increase total assets and total liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 by approximately $20,000 and
$19,000 primarily due to classifying certain advances from customers as liabilities under the new standard,
whereas these advances were netted against inventory under existing GAAP.Adoption ofASU No. 2017-07
has no impact on total assets and total liabilities. The new standards have no impact on cash flows reported
in 2017 and 2016. The impact of the new revenue standard on our 2017 and 2016 financial results may
not be representative of the impact on our financial position and operating results in subsequent years.
ASC Topic 606 requires additional detailed disclosures regarding the Company’s contracts with customers,
including disclosure of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 which
we are continuing to assess. We have identified and implemented changes to the Company’s business
processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings
allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The
undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings
had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to
undistributed earnings.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating
securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating
securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

(1) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revises the U.S.
corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1,
2018, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits
of $1,210 related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction
in the corporate tax rate. We also recorded a provisional tax expense of $159 related to tax on non-
U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA.
In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related to the application of
a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be
increased (tax basis adjustment).
In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $177 was recorded as a result of the settlement of the
2011-2012 federal tax audit.
In 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of
$207 and $105.

The deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The TCJA one-time repatriation tax liability effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred
from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings
from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such
earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.

In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 the
amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the TCJA represent reasonable estimates based
on our analysis to date and are considered to be provisional and subject to revision during 2018. Provisional
amounts were recorded for the repatriation tax, the remeasurement of our 2017 U.S. net deferred tax
liabilities and ancillary state tax effects. These amounts are considered to be provisional as we continue
to assess available tax methods and elections and refine our computations. In addition, further regulatory
guidance related to the TCJA is expected to be issued in 2018 which may result in changes to our current
estimates. Any revisions to the estimated impacts of TCJA will be recorded quarterly until the computations
are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest
and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The
amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,736,
$1,557 and $1,617, respectively, of which $1,568, $1,402 and $1,479 would affect the effective tax rate,
if recognized. As of December 31, 2017, these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax
issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit and
tax basis adjustments. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as
the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.

Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) began the 2013-2014 federal tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination
in major state and non-U.S. jurisdictions for the 2001-2016 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions
for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.

Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably
possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state matters
under audit may decrease by up to $540 and $430, respectively, based on current estimates.

based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of
the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables,
if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the
collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency,
requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers
expected to be collected after one year were $172 and $172 at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts
receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning
their determination or ultimate realization.

Accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not
material.

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that
we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31,
2017 and 2016, we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $77 and $55,
of which $66 and $44 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these
impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables.

Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income
and principal becomes not probable.
Income is recognized when financing receivables become
contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. The average recorded investment
in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $46 and the related interest
income was insignificant.

The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level
of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates
and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness
of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our
customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies.

Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below:

$2,289

At December 31, 2017, our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied
default rates that averaged 22.6%, 4.7% and 0.9% to the exposure associated with those receivables.

Customer Financing Exposure

Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely
tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced
valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced
finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is
concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced
greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.

The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at
December 31:

717 Aircraft ($269 and $301 accounted for as operating leases)
747-8 Aircraft ($467 and $1,086 accounted for as operating leases)
MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)
757 Aircraft ($27 and $43 accounted for as operating leases)
747-400 Aircraft ($88 and $149 Accounted for as operating leases)
737 Aircraft ($127 and $103 Accounted for as operating leases)

Note 10 – Other Assets

Sea Launch

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, Other assets included $356 of receivables related to our former investment
in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch’s
bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows:
S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia) – $223, PO Yuzhnoye
Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44.

In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking
reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners. In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central
District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, we reached an agreement which
we believe will enable us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next
several years. We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection
with the court judgment. We continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and
intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure
reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional
charges.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Other assets included $137 and $143 of receivables related to
indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree
medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in the Delaware Superior Court seeking to
enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension
and retiree medical obligations. During 2017, the court ruled against Boeing and denied our claim. In
January 2018, Boeing filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. We believe we have
substantial arguments on appeal and expect to fully recover from Spirit.

The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs
expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30
years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because
of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs
and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a
range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably
possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our
experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where
the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the high end
of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $868
and $857.

In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered
into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a
specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be
exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative
information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a
change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in
commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during
the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.

Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2017 have expiration dates from 2018 through 2026.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,462 and $1,485. As of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on
certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $155 and $126 and the fair
value of the related trade-in aircraft was $155 and $126.

Financing Commitments

Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales
campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $10,221 and $14,847 as of December 31, 2017
and 2016. The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2017
are as follows:

As of December 31, 2017, all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less
than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required
for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under
which funding would be provided.

We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating
to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters
of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,708 and $4,701 as of December 31,
2017 and 2016.

Commitments to ULA

We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital
contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an
inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2017, ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under
the inventory supply agreement was $120. See Note 6.

F/A-18

At December 31, 2017, our backlog included 26 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. We
have begun work or authorized suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those already in backlog in
anticipation of future orders. At December 31, 2017, we had $155 of capitalized precontract costs and
$855 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with F/A-18 aircraft not yet ordered.

Company Owned Life Insurance

McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which
are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these
obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans
in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31,
2017 and 2016, the cash surrender value was $489 and $483 and the total loans were $470 and $456.
As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the
net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017
and 2016.

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

In November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018),
which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget topline higher than the administration’s budget request from May.
While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the House and Senate
appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the
administration’s request. On February 9, 2018, Congress passed a fifth Continuing Resolution that
maintains current funding levels through March 23, 2018 and includes increases to the Budget Control
Act caps for defense and non-defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the Budget Control
Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a
result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress
acts to repeal or suspend this law.

Funding timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus
spending bill before the expiration of the current Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could
result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts
or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD, the
Department of Transportation, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our
ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.

and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes
could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these
impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or
cash flows.

BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts

Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of
the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development
work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites.
The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger
termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and
revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example,
during 2017, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $471 on the KC-46A Tanker program.
Moreover, this and our other fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward
losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs.

KC-46A Tanker

In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and
deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development
(EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex
designs and systems integration. In 2016, the USAF authorized two low rate initial production (LRIP) lots
for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. In January 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot
for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion.

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $347 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,024 of potential
termination liabilities to suppliers.

Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts

Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government,
which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with
the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed.
If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge
and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government.

We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the
form of guarantees.

The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential
payments represent a “worst-case scenario,” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to
pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could
liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of
liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities.

Contingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase
commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated
proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase
price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.

Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against
potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory
included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which
ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,288 of the $1,360 of inventory that was
contributed by us and has yet to consume $72. Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded
revenues and cost of sales of $1,528 through December 31, 2017. ULA has made payments of $1,740 to
us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $48 of net indemnification payments to ULA.

We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to
obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for four satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a
complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for
the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a
third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract.
During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing for
each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. During the fourth
quarter of 2016, the USAF appealed the ASBCA’s ruling. In April 2017, the USAF withdrew its appeal. If
ULAis ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification
payment up to $261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions.

Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related
to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified
ULA that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government
contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional
$114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November

The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeing and ULA
filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs
from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were
offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without
merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017, and during the fourth quarter, Boeing filed
a motion for summary judgment for full recovery of its costs. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that
some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record
pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the
DCMA.

Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne
Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester,
Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing
environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future
claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result,
we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and
therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities
and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included
in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11.

Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a
guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain
specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with
less than investment-grade credit and are collateralized by certain assets. Current outstanding credit
guarantees expire through 2036.

Industrial Revenue Bonds

Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or
construction of real and personal property at our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include
a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these
properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and
therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB
proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements
of Financial Position.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $166 and
$64.

Note 13 – Debt

On February 16, 2017, we issued $900 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $300 due March 1, 2022
that bear an annual interest rate of 2.125%, $300 due March 1, 2027 that bear an annual interest rate of
2.8%, and $300 due March 1, 2047 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.65%. The notes are unsecured
senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $871, after deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $541, $535 and $497 for the years ended December
31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital
interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were
$527, $523 and $488 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and
the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016.

We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit
of the plans’ participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations
as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments.

We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health
care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to
certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half
those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees
covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.
The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and
the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other
assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension
plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in
the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued
liabilities.

The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using
a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four
rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from
bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are
omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields
are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level
beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount
rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50.

The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical
returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset
classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption
represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net
periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets
assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting
standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of
plan assets. As of December 31, 2017, the MRVA was approximately $2,260 less than the fair market
value of assets.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including
ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims
against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and
adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect:

Effect on total of service and interest cost

Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to
satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and
address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term
investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving
a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and
managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks
and investment opportunities identified.

We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine
the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics,
funding
requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks
to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and
investable where possible.Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic
investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement
investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term
investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the
target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual
and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:

Global
equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various
industries and market capitalizations.

Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in
a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate
Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments
in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments
in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity
investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S.
leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.

Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset
classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven,
relative value, long-short and multi-strategy.

investment
Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual
guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures,
swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market
exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the
desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset
allocation.

As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 5.0% and 6.0% for
fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 6.9%
and 1.2% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

In August 2017, the Company elected to contribute $3,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An
independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The
liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status
risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching
and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall
investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment
strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for
publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters
for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives.
Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies,
custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-
specific valuation testing.

of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the
inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable
inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

a security’s relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available,
or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in
developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base
spreads.

Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are
calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives
included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with
inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer
broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily
variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of
the table.

Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate
account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities
and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach
with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not
available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy
for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach
based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.

Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments,
which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based
comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use
NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.

Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which
include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based
comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are
adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks
are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-
traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin
which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Hedge fund NAVs are generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily
done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or
instrument held.

Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated
and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some
investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar
fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of
these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations.

OPB PlanAssets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised
of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach
based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these
assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA), as well as rules governing funding of our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant
in 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, we contributed $500 in cash and $3,500 in common stock. We
do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2018.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be
paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’
share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only.

Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which
is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the
assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then
any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement
medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.

Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s
obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on
plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.

Defined Contribution Plans

We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the
Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $1,522, $1,413
and $768 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 15 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements

Share-Based Compensation

Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance
restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees,
officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock
authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000.

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out
of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares
will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during
2018.

Restricted Stock Units

In February 2017, 2016 and 2015, we granted to our executives 523,835, 777,837 and 590,778 restricted
stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $178.72,
$117.50 and $154.64 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in
common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates
employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary)
will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period.
In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs
awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to

below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on
the date of grant.

The number of vested but undistributed RSUs at December 31, 2017 was not significant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s
total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award
payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value
(excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout
amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If
an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the
employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a
proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases,
the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

In February 2017, 2016 and 2015, we granted to our executives 492,273, 721,176 and 556,203 PBRSUs
as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the
three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were
estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model
includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents.

Other Compensation Arrangements

Performance Awards

Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals
at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at
the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending
on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has
the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance
period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over
the performance period.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term
incentive program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period
following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required
to pay out for the 2017, 2016 and 2015 Performance Awards is $352, $318 and $312, respectively. The
2015 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2018.

Deferred Compensation

The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary,
bonus, certain other incentive awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these
amounts among 22 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account.

Total expense related to deferred compensation was $240, $46 and $63 in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked
to market was $1,547 and $1,289.

On December 11, 2017, the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to $18,000 of common stock,
replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized
funds or is otherwise terminated.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000
shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.

Note 17 – Derivative Financial Instruments

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We
use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions,
specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts
hedge forecasted transactions through 2024. We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase
commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our
commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021.

Fair Value Hedges

Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value
hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported
in Boeing Capital interest expense.

We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing
objectives and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for
accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing
market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment.

Notional Amounts and Fair Values

The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position as of December 31 were as follows:

For foreign exchange contracts
with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we
default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require
collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and
commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at
December 31, 2017 was $13. At December 31, 2017, there was no collateral posted related to our
derivatives.

Note 18 – Significant Group Concentrations of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers
and the U.S. government. Of the $13,639 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing
included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017, $5,572 related
predominantly to commercial aircraft customers ($2,512 of accounts receivable and $3,060 of customer
financing) and $5,989 related to the U.S. government.

Of the $3,061 in gross customer financing, $1,828 related to customers we believe have less than
investment-grade credit including Silk Way, American, and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with
14%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security
in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well.

Other Risk

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 37% of our total workforce was represented by collective
bargaining agreements.

Note 19 – Fair Value Measurements

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.
Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level
2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values
estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of
identical or comparable
instruments.

Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward
contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the
contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income
approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by
the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow
analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.

Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable
inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended
December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related
assets as of the impairment date:

Investments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using
an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair
value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from
a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft
publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management
reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market
trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific
aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more
generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the
aircraft.

The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates
currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt
that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For
our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on
our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our
debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar

estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing
of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted

Note 20 – Legal Proceedings

Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other
matters are pending against us.

In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal
or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could
involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/
or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or
subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges,
based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of
any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect
on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Note 21 – Segment Information

Effective July 1, 2017, we now operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS, and BCC. The new
segment, BGS, brings together the Commercial Aviation Services businesses, previously included in the
BCA segment, and certain BDS businesses (primarily those previously included in the Global Services &
Support segment). All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 51
for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. Prior year numbers
have been revised to conform to the current segment presentation.

BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry
worldwide.

BDS is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and
related services: manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and
engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration.

BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-
based services to commercial and government customers worldwide.

BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global
business operations, intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between
segments.

In addition, BGS segment revenue and
costs include certain services provided to other segments. The revenues and cost of sales for these
transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes,
we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from
Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance
milestones.

Unallocated Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense

Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense represent the portion of pension and other
postretirement benefit costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes.
Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA. Pension costs are
allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S. Government Cost
Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions
than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are
allocated to business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.

Gross profit is calculated as Total revenues minus Total costs and expenses. Total costs and expenses
includes Cost of products, Cost of services and Boeing Capital interest expense.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded incremental tax
benefits of $1,051, primarily related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities.

During 2017 and 2016, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the U.S. Air
Force resulted in reach-forward losses. We recorded $329 and $142 in the third and first quarter of 2017.
We recorded $312, $573 and $243 in the fourth, second and first quarter of 2016, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2016, delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities for the
Commercial Crew program resulted in a charge of $162.

During the second quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,188
and $70 on the 747 program.

During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft for the 787
program are not commercially saleable, and we reclassified costs of $1,235 associated with these aircraft
from 787 program inventory to research and development expense.

During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an incremental tax benefit of $440 that related to the
application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision. We also recorded a tax benefit of $177 as a result
of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit settlements.

We increased our quarterly dividend from $1.09 to $1.42 in December 2016 and to $1.71 in December
2017.

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12,
2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2018, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Acompany’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2017 and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of December 31, 2017.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
in Item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.

the original Next-Generation 737s when they
entered service. With new CFM International
LEAP-1B engines, a more efficient structural
design, advanced technology winglets and lower
maintenance requirements, the entire MAX family
has been designed to offer exceptional perfor-
mance, flexibility and efficiency. Every 737 MAX
will be fitted with the 737 Boeing Sky Interior,
giving passengers a more spacious-feeling cabin,
overhead bins that disappear into the ceiling while
carrying more luggage and soothing LED lighting.
Since its launch, the 737 MAX has received more
than 4,300 orders from 92 airlines and leasing
customers worldwide. The first airplane rolled out
of the factory in December 2015. The first suc-
cessful flight occurred in January 2016 and first
737 MAX 8 delivery took place in May 2017. The
first MAX 9 is scheduled to deliver in 2018. This
will be followed in 2019 by the introduction of a
smaller, long-range MAX 7 and the high-capacity
MAX 8. The MAX 10 is expected to be introduced
in the 2020 time frame.

passengers in a typical three-class configuration
(66 more than the 747-400). Both the passenger
and freighter variants of the 747-8 have an
increased maximum takeoff weight of 987,000
pounds (447,700 kilograms) and represent a new
benchmark in fuel efficiency and noise reduction,
allowing airlines to lower fuel costs and fly into
more airports at more times of the day. With
18 percent fewer carbon emissions and 30 per-
cent less noise, the 747-8 is more efficient and
quieter than the 747-400.

The Boeing 737 is the world’s best-selling family
of commercial jetliners. The Next-Generation
737-700, -800 and -900ER models incorporate
advanced technology and design features that
improve fuel efficiency and reduce operating
costs while delivering superior passenger satis-
faction. The Next-Generation 737 offers the best
on-time schedule performance in the industry.
It spans the entire 126- to 220-seat market
with ranges of more than 3,000 nautical miles
(5,500 kilometers). This flexibility gives operators
the ability to respond effectively to market
needs. The 737 family also includes four models
of Boeing Business Jets—derivatives of the
Next-Generation 737-700, 737-700 Convertible,
737-800 and 737-900ER. In 2017, the 737 factory
in Renton, Wash., increased the production rate
to 47 airplanes per month, up from 42 airplanes.
We plan to further increase the production rate
to 52 airplanes per month in 2018 and 57 per
month in 2019.

Launched in August 2011, the 737 MAX is a
family of airplanes that builds on the strengths
of the Next-Generation 737. The family includes
the 737 MAX 7, MAX 8, MAX 9 and MAX 10. It
also includes the Boeing Business Jets MAX 7,
MAX 8 and MAX 9 models. The 737 MAX is
designed to be 14 percent more fuel-efficient
than today’s most efficient Next-Generation
737s and 20 percent more fuel-efficient than

The 747-8 Intercontinental and the 747-8 Freighter
are the latest-generation airplanes of Boeing’s
747 family. The airplanes feature new wings with
raked wingtips and more fuel-efficient engines
than those on the 747-400. The 747-8 Freighter,
first delivered in 2011, carries 16 percent more
cargo volume than the 747-400 Freighter and is
the industry’s only nose-cargo-loading jet. The
747-8 Intercontinental is offered as a Boeing
Business Jets aircraft or a passenger plane. The
interior of the passenger model is inspired by
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, including a sculpted
ceiling, LED dynamic lighting, larger bins and a
new staircase design. The Intercontinental, first
delivered in 2012, is the only airplane operating
in the 400- to 500-seat market, seating 410

The 767 Freighter shares all the advancements
in avionics, aerodynamics, materials and propul-
sion that contribute to the success of the
767-300ER passenger airplane. Excellent fuel
efficiency, operational flexibility, low noise
levels and an all-digital flight deck allow the
767 Freighter to support time-critical cargo
schedules even at airports with stringent noise
and emissions standards. Also available is the
767-2C, a new commercial freighter based on the
767-200ER, that is being modified into KC-46A
tankers for the U.S. Air Force and the Japan Air
Self-Defense Force.

For airlines that want to win on the world stage
and grow now, the 777 family, which includes
the 777X, offers flagship status and more growth
potential than the competition. The 777 has
excellent performance, economics, range capa-
bility and efficiency to help operators maximize
profits. That’s why the 777 family is the most
popular and commercially successful twin-aisle
aircraft of all time. The 777’s long range (up to
7,370 nautical miles or 13,650 kilometers for
the 777-300ER and 8,555 nautical miles or
15,840 kilometers for the 777-200LR) and large
payload capability (313 to 425 passengers in a
typical two-class configuration) give operators
access to the world’s fastest-growing passenger
markets. Boeing Business Jets also offers
777-300ER and 777-200LR models. The
777 Freighter with 112 tons (102 metric tons) of
revenue payload capability is the largest and
longest-range twin-engine freighter and has the
lowest trip costs of any large freighter. Enhancing
the market-leading 777 family, the 777X was

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a family of techno-
logically advanced, long-range commercial
airplanes that provide exceptional environmental
performance and an experience passengers
prefer. With the most advanced composite fuse-
lage design, a more-electric system architecture
and a choice of modern engines, the 787 family
reduces fuel usage and emissions by up to 25
percent compared to the airplanes it replaces.
As the opening of Boeing’s twin-aisle airplanes
portfolio, the 787 family flies 242 to 330 passen-
gers from 6,430 to 7,635 nautical miles (11,910 to
14,140 kilometers), allowing airlines to open and
grow new nonstop routes profitably. In addition
to unprecedented fuel economy, low operating
costs and excellent cargo capacity, the 787 family
delivers benefits that passengers prefer, such
as soothing LED lighting; the largest windows of
any commercial airplane, which offer a view from

launched in November 2013 and will be the
largest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the
world. Offering airlines new levels of efficiency
and growth, the 777X has two family members:
the 777-8, with more seats and range capability
and lower operating costs than the similarly sized
A350-1000, and the 777-9, which seats more
than 400 passengers and will have a range of
greater than 7,500 nautical miles (14,000 kilo-
meters). The 777X builds upon the reliability and
superb performance that our customers love and
trust about the 777 family, while adding addi-
tional technologies and passenger experience
enhancements derived from the 787. First delivery
of the 777X is expected in 2020.

every seat; the industry’s largest overhead bins;
cleaner, more comfortable air; low interior noise;
and a smoother ride. The family also includes the
Boeing Business Jets 787-8 and 787-9, offering
2,400 square feet (223 square meters) of space
and capable of flying almost anywhere in the
world nonstop. The first 787-8 was delivered in
2011, and the first 787-9 was delivered in 2014.
The 787 is the fastest twin-aisle airplane in history
to reach 500 deliveries (2016) and 1 million
passengers (2017). Boeing began assembly of
the third and longest 787, the super-efficient
787-10, in fall 2016 and is on track for first delivery
in 2018.

F-15E Strike Eagle

The C-17 Globemaster III, the world’s most
advanced and versatile airlifter, is designed for
long-range transport of equipment, supplies and
military troops. The C-17 is used extensively to
support combat operations, disaster response,
humanitarian relief and aeromedical evacuation
missions. Through the end of 2017, Boeing
delivered 275 C-17s, including 52 for customers
in Australia, Canada, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the

United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and
the 12-member Strategic Airlift Capability initia-
tive of NATO and Partnership for Peace nations.
Although C-17 production has completed,
Boeing will continue to provide system-level
performance-based logistics and sustainment
for the entire fleet, including material manage-
ment and depot maintenance support.

The Commercial Crew Transportation System
comprises the Crew Space Transportation
(CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft, launch vehicle,
mission operations and ground systems.
Boeing designed the reusable, capsule-shaped
Starliner with proven materials and subsystem
technologies. In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing
up to $4.2 billion to design, develop and operate
the Starliner, America’s next-generation space

system. The contract includes an uncrewed and
a crewed flight test with one NASA astronaut
and one Boeing astronaut on board to verify that
the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system
can launch, maneuver in orbit and dock to the
International Space Station. Boeing received two
service mission orders to the space station in
2015, and four more missions were awarded
in 2016.

The EA-18G Growler is the only tactical air
combat platform that delivers full-spectrum
airborne electronic attack (AEA) capability along
with the targeting and self-defense capabilities
derived from the U.S. Navy’s frontline fighter, the
F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. It is the most advanced
AEA platform in the U.S. inventory, providing
tactical jamming and electronic protection for
U.S., NATO and coalition forces around the world.

The Growler is on contract for integration of the
Next Generation Jammer, which will protect and
enable all joint force aircraft operating in high-
threat environments for decades to come. Boeing
delivered 12 Growlers to the Royal Australian Air
Force in 2017.

2017 deliveries: 23*

Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous,
extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle that
can be used for a variety of missions such as
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
The 51-foot-long (15.5 meter) vehicle includes a
modular payload section for multiple uses. The
ability to carry such a large payload enables the
vehicle to perform at sea for months at a time

delivering a more affordable, mission-capable
solution over traditional systems. Echo Voyager
requires no support vessel for launch or recovery.
The U.S. Navy selected Boeing for the first phase
of the Orca program, the Navy’s competition to
design and produce an extra-large unmanned
undersea vehicle.

The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is the U.S. Navy’s
newest strike fighter, deployed in both air-
dominance and precision-strike roles. Through
an evolutionary approach, including incremental
upgrades to the APG-79 active electronically
scanned array radar, the Super Hornet contin-
uously improves overall mission capability and
supportability to stay ahead of future threats. The
Super Hornet’s advanced sensor and information
suite collects and fuses data from off-board
sources and on-board sensors to seamlessly
detect and eliminate air, ground or sea-based
threats. Boeing has also developed the Block III

Super Hornet to complement existing and future
air wing capabilities while outpacing threats for
decades to come, featuring enhanced network
capability, conformal fuel tanks, Infrared Search
& Track, an advanced cockpit system, signature
reduction and a 9,000+ hour airframe. The
Super Hornet is built by an industry team of
Boeing, General Electric Aviation, Raytheon and
Northrop Grumman. The Fiscal Year 2018 budget
included a requirement for 80 Super Hornets
through the Future Years Defense Program. The
U.S. Navy requested 10 additional Super Hornets
in their FY18 unfunded priorities list.

The Advanced F-15, F-15C/D Eagle and F-15E
Strike Eagle currently flown by customers provide
unparalleled performance. With its service
ceiling, top speed, range, endurance and payload
capacity, the F-15 is arguably the most capable
air superiority fighter currently in service. With
its twin engines for greater performance and
survivability, active electronically scanned array
radar and electronic warfare systems, the F-15 is
well suited for both air superiority and multirole
missions. Current Advanced F-15 models in pro-
duction include digital fly-by-wire flight controls,

two additional weapon hard points (wing stations
1 and 9) for maximum payload capability, and
advanced cockpits. The F-15 is currently flown
by the U.S. Air Force and five other nations and
will be a critical component of the U.S. Air Force’s
combat power well into the 2040s. Boeing also
offers performance-based logistics sustainment
services to F-15 operators, which include varied
levels of support tailored to each customer’s
needs for the entire fleet.

JDAM guidance kits convert existing unguided
warheads into more capable, precision-guided
air-to-surface weapons, making JDAM the war-
fighter’s weapon of choice. Since 1998, Boeing
has delivered around 330,000 conventional
JDAM guidance kits. The Laser JDAM variant
provides a modular laser sensor kit that is easily
installed on the front of existing JDAM-enabled
weapons to prosecute mobile and maritime

NanoRacks began to develop the first privately
funded commercial airlock, which will increase

ness. Also in 2017, Boeing unveiled its concept
for a Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway habitat that
draws on technology from the station and from
Boeing’s 702 satellite family.

targets. The winged JDAM ER more than triples
the range of a conventional JDAM for additional
standoff and threat protection for the warfighter.
In 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a
$3.2 billion contract for delivery of JDAMs into
2020. JDAM derivatives are sold to the U.S. Air
Force, U.S. Navy and more than 30 international
military customers.

The KC-46A Pegasus is a 767-based, multirole
tanker that will revolutionize the air-mobility
mission for the warfighter. Capable of refueling
all U.S., allied and coalition military aircraft by
a sixth-generation fly-by-wire boom, wing air
refueling pods or an integrated centerline drogue
system, the KC-46A will also carry passengers,
cargo and patients. In 2017, Boeing was awarded
$2.1 billion for its third KC-46 production lot of 15

aircraft. The program is now on contract with the
U.S. Air Force for 38 tankers and has completed
refueling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10,
C-17, A-10 and KC-46 aircraft. The KC-46A will
replace 179 of the U.S. Air Force’s aging KC-135
tankers. Japan became the program’s first
international customer in December 2017, when
Boeing signed a $279 million contract for the
country’s first KC-46.

Boeing integrates high-power lasers into com-
pact, tactical and strategic systems that identify,
track and defeat threats over air, land and sea. In
2017, Boeing was awarded a contract for multiple
Compact Laser Weapon Systems (CLWS) as a
result of field tests proving the CLWS ability to
destroy low, slow and small unmanned aerial

In 2017, Boeing and Luxembourg-based SES
announced a contract for Boeing to build
seven medium-earth orbit (MEO) satellites that
will deliver efficient high-performance data
communications services to users around the
world. The satellites, which will be part of SES’
O3b mPOWER constellation, will carry Boeing’s
most-advanced digital payload technology

The P-8 is a military derivative of the Boeing
Next-Generation 737-800 providing anti-
submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities,
as well as armed intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance. Boeing is under contract for
98 P-8A Poseidon variants for the U.S. Navy
and 12 for the Royal Australian Air Force, as well
as an additional four P-8I aircraft for the Indian
Navy. In 2017, Boeing delivered 19 P-8A aircraft,

The PAC-3 Missile Seeker uses hit-to-kill guidance
capability to intercept and destroy tactical ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles and hostile aircraft
through direct body-to-body impact. Boeing
produces and delivers the PAC-3 Missile Seeker
to system prime contractor Lockheed Martin.
The seeker provides active guidance data to
the missile, enabling the missile to acquire the
target shortly before intercept, select the optimal

aimpoint and initiate terminal guidance to ensure
target kill. The PAC-3 Missile Seeker is deployed
with U.S. Army and Army National Guard air
defense units and has been purchased by several
international customers. Boeing has delivered

Boeing subsidiary Liquid Robotics offers the
Wave Glider, which is a long-duration ocean
robot that operates at the surface and provides
a communications link between sea, air and
space. Wave Gliders expand how ocean data
is collected, transforming how we monitor and
protect the ocean.

As the U.S. Department of Defense’s highest-
capacity military communications satellite system,
WGS addresses the military’s need for high data-
rate communications. Nine WGS satellites have
been launched into orbit and are performing

their missions. The Block II series includes
enhancements that provide additional bandwidth
required by airborne intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance platforms.

The Boeing-built X-37B OTV completed its fourth
successful flight for the U.S. Air Force in May
2017, establishing a new 718-day record for flight
duration in a reusable space vehicle. The vehicle’s
landing at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle

Landing Facility and Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station marked the first autonomous landing
and recovery at that site. In September 2017, the
X-37B OTV returned to space for a fifth flight.

Across commercial and defense aviation
segments, digital aviation & analytics provides
operational efficiency solutions to pilots and
aircraft operators. The software and data
analytics-powered tools help customers reduce
fuel consumption, optimize crew utilization,
minimize disruption impact and increase asset
availability. With dozens of products powered by
Boeing AnalytX, which turns data into insight,

digital aviation & analytics provides expertise in
everything from asset health management and
predictive maintenance to supply and enterprise
resource planning. As e-enabled aircraft and the
vast amount of information continue to increase,
how we analyze data will be critically important
for determining how commercial and defense
customers eliminate surprises and best operate
their fleets.

Engineering, Modifications & Maintenance pro-
vides technical fleet solutions for Boeing Global
Services’ commercial and government customers
around the world to convert, sustain and upgrade
any type of aircraft flown today, with efficient
custom and standard services in engineering
and touch-labor. The diverse team has a
formal presence in numerous countries and

performs field service work in most markets.
Seamless support is possible thanks to Fleet
Care engineering services—supporting full
fleet operations—in addition to multiple global
field service teams, heavy airframe modification
facilities, customer service and maintenance,
repair, overhaul (MRO) operations centers, and
24/7 technical support for spare parts.

Boeing Global Services’ supply chain operates
one of the industry’s most comprehensive parts
and services networks. Using supplier manage-
ment expertise and advanced analytics capa-
bilities, we support all aspects of aircraft fleet,
parts and service, including airplane-on-ground
support. We also deliver customer-focused
solutions such as component repair or landing
gear overhaul and exchange. Whether it’s for

aircraft in or out of production, we understand
the material and logistics support for aircraft,
notably spare parts, retrofit kits, distribution
and life-cycle management, as well as perfor-
mance-based logistics agreements such as the
C-17 Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment
Program. Global Services has distribution centers
and component repair facilities in nine countries,
supporting customers worldwide.

of aviation and provide a complete solution,
including services such as infrastructure and/or
program development and facilities management.

787-10 retains more 
than 95 percent 
commonality while 
adding seats and 
cargo capacity. With 
a 25 percent better 
fuel-per-seat rate and 
lower emissions than 
the airplanes it will 
replace, the 787-10 
sets a new benchmark 
for fuel efficiency and 
operating economics.
