Annual Report 2017

Annual Report 2017

To our  
shareholders

At 3M, we are united by a vision that is 
inspirational, aspirational and authentic  
to who we are. It describes what we  
strive to do every day:

3M Technology Advancing Every Company 

3M Products Enhancing Every Home
3M Innovation Improving Every Life

In partnership with our customers, we use 
science to improve lives and help solve 
society’s toughest challenges – from 
improving air quality and worker safety, 
to advancing health care and enabling the 
transportation of tomorrow. Underlying  
3M’s success are our fundamental strengths: 
our 46 technology platforms, state-of-the-art 
manufacturing capabilities, global reach and 
brand equity. Yet as I often say, 3M’s most 
valuable resource is the curiosity, passion 
and skill of our 91,000 people around the 
world. I salute our team for their hard work 
and contributions to 3M, and for making 
2017 a fantastic year for our enterprise.

Financial Results
By nearly any metric, 3M has never been stronger 
– which is reflected in our 2017 performance. 
It was a year marked by robust growth and a 
double-digit rise in earnings per share*, along 
with increased investments in the business. 

Earnings were $9.17 per share*, which was a 12 percent 
increase year-on-year. We accelerated organic growth 
to 5 percent, with growth across all of our business 
groups and geographic areas. We posted free cash 
flow conversion of 100 percent, along with a return 
on invested capital of 21 percent – which marks our 
fifth straight year with an ROIC above 20 percent. 
For the fourth consecutive year we expanded 
margins, which reflects the strength of 3M’s portfolio 
and our ongoing focus on productivity. Margins 
companywide were 25 percent, with all business 
groups above 21 percent. Our team delivered 
these margins on total sales of $32 billion. 

In 2017 we also deployed significant capital to grow  
the business, which included investing more than  
$5 billion combined in research and development,  
cap-ex and acquisitions. At the same time, we returned 
$2.8 billion to our shareholders through cash dividends, 
and we repurchased $2.1 billion of 3M shares. And as 
you may know, we have already announced a 16 percent 
increase in your Q1 2018 dividend – which marks 
3M’s 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. 

Building for the future
Beyond financial results, we continued to execute our 
three key levers, which are big value-creators both  
today and into the future.

The first lever is Portfolio Management, a process that 
we have intensified over the last several years. Since 
2012, in fact, 3M has realigned from six business groups 
to five and from 40 businesses to 24, while making a 
number of strategic acquisitions and divestitures. 

In 2017 3M completed the acquisition of Scott Safety 
– a premier safety solutions company – to build 
strength-on-strength in our fast-growing personal safety 
portfolio. Last year we also divested four businesses that
no longer align with our strategic objectives. 

Portfolio Management is strengthening 3M’s 
competitiveness, and making us even more relevant to 
our customers and the marketplace. Equally important, it 
is also allowing us to prioritize resources to our biggest 
and best opportunities. 

To that end, we’ve identified several high-growth, 
high-value product platforms – including automotive 
electrification, structural adhesives and data centers – 
that we will be accelerating investments in for  
2018 and beyond. All in, these platforms represent  
a $30 billion addressable market opportunity, and  
we are well positioned to capitalize. 

The second lever is Investing in Innovation. Research and 
development remains the heartbeat of 3M. It enables us 
to deliver premium value to our customers and premium 
returns to our shareholders. In 2017 we increased 
investments in R&D to $1.9 billion, or about 6 percent 
of sales. As is evident in our results, these investments 
are paying off – in terms of organic growth, and also 
our strong margins and return on invested capital. 

R&D is just one element that powers 3M’s innovation 
engine. Another is our company’s culture, which 
encourages risk-taking, collaboration and big thinking. 
All 3Mers – including our 8,000 scientists – strive to do 
things not just better, but also differently. When we can 
invent an entirely different solution to a problem, that is 
when we create game-changing value. 

Business Transformation – the third lever – starts and 
ends with our customers. It includes standardizing and 
optimizing global processes so we can serve customers 
with even greater agility and efficiency. The backbone 
of Business Transformation is a global ERP system, and 
its implementation remains on track. The rollout in West 
Europe is nearly complete, and we have started initial 
deployments in the United States.

Business Transformation is already benefitting our 
customers and 3M, and those benefits will accelerate 
in the coming years. By 2020 our efforts will result in 
$500–$700 million in annual operational savings, and 
another $500 million reduction in working capital.

*Earnings per share-diluted, excluding net impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—a non-GAAP  measure.   
See the Overview section of Item 7 of 3M’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

In summary, 2017 was a successful year as we 
executed the 3M Playbook, delivered strong 
results and bolstered our foundation for the future. 
Importantly, we did so while staying true to our 
company’s core values. Last year, in fact, 3M 
was again named one of the world’s most ethical 
companies by Ethisphere Institute, while also 
receiving the prestigious Catalyst Award for our  
work to advance diversity and inclusion. We also 
continue to lead in sustainability, which includes 
helping our customers reduce their emissions by  
more than 10 million metric tons every year through 
use of 3M products. 

As I look across our enterprise, 3M is strong and 
getting stronger. Going forward, we will continue 
evolving into an even more competitive, innovative 
and agile company. I know 3M’s best days are ahead. 

As always, I thank you – our shareholders – for your 
confidence, our customers for their partnership and 
the 3M team for their contributions to our success.

Distribution 
 
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous 
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. 
Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — 
a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed 
significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth. 
 
Research and Patents 
 
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s 
sales and profit growth. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.850 billion in 2017, $1.735 billion in 
2016 and $1.763 billion in 2015. Research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of 
scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.335 billion in 2017, 
$1.225 billion in 2016 and $1.223 billion in 2015. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally 
developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization 
of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated 
with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments. 
 
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses 
to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream 
of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods 
according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries 
where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, 
depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 
The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, 
no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s 
business segments. 
 
Raw Materials 
 
In 2017, the Company continued to manage year-on-year raw material input costs, benefiting from input management, 
reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material 
categories in oil-derivative chemical feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock 
categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company 
is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is 
difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided 
disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic 

7 

relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend 
category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. 

Environmental Law Compliance

3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has 
made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in 
remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental 
Matters and Litigation” in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies).

Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or 
future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted 
basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the 
Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital 
projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives.

In 2017, 3M expended about $33 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes 
expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to 
current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution 
control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery 
units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. 
Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for 
remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $66 million over the next two years for new 
or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.

While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or 
operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its 
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations” in Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the 
Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and 
financial performance. Words such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” 
“estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such 
forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to: 

the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of
financial performance, and market position,

• worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange

rates, financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters or climate change
affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers,
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated
products,
the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
future availability of and access to credit markets,
pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,
asset impairments,
tax liabilities,
information technology security, and
the effects of changes in tax (including the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), environmental and other
laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate.

The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are 
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those 
reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these 
factors can be found in this document, including, among others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,” “Financial Condition and Liquidity” and 
annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 
1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning 
factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our 
reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the 
Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”

* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.
The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the
United States. The Company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely
affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth,
disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary

10 

conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and 
other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; 
social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change 
affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of 
capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 
 
* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company’s credit ratings are important to 
3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 
3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well 
as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a 
stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors 
Service. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of 
lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the 
future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and 
could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets. 
 
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s 
products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of 
competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer 
order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases 
which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s 
ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of 
products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for 
some of the Company’s products. 
 
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected 
growth rates in its sales and earnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and 
approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results 
of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. 
dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. 
 
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product 
offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. 
This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify 
viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There 
are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful. 
 
* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, 
compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased 
demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. The Company depends on 
various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied 
by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted 
due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the 
Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the 
Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the 
Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions 
and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. The 
Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make 
acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, 

11 

future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the 
anticipated synergies. 
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than 
estimated. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business 
transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 
3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to 
serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of 
an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected 
productivity improvements will be realized. 
 
* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased 
implementation of an ERP system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. 
Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the 
Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, 
exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary 
course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by 
third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business 
processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business 
information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to 
privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including 
employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems 
and data), the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, 
disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer 
viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or 
other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and 
including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to the 
Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the 
Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a 
worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, 
disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s 
business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee 
that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured. 
 
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could 
adversely impact our results. The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding 
obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan 
assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan 
funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. 
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, 
including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters. The outcome of these legal proceedings may 
differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often 
difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of 
liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not 
susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant 
regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development 
could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash 
flows in any particular period. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the 
associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies” within the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

OVERVIEW 
 
3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. 
As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M improved the alignment of its businesses around 
markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods 
presented. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; 
Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, 
Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.

Excluding the $762 million impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), net income was 
$1.285 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, an increase of 11.7 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to the fourth 
quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net income attributable to 3M was $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share, 
compared to $5.050 billion, or $8.16 per diluted share, for the full year 2016, a decrease of 2.8 percent on a per diluted 
share basis. Excluding the 2017 impact related to TCJA, net income was $5.620 billion, or $9.17 per diluted share, an 
increase of 12.4 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to 2016. The Company refers to various measures 
excluding the 2017 net impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These non-GAAP measures are further 
described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows. 

Organic growth/productivity in 2017 includes benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost 
decreases from sourcing cost reduction projects, and business transformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M’s 
productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher defined benefit pension expenses. During both the 
fourth quarter and full year 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year benefit. 

Acquisitions and divestitures decreased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017, 
while increasing earnings per diluted share by 54 cents year-on-year for the full year 2017. Acquisition impacts, which 
are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate primarily to the acquisition of Scott Safety (fourth 
quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety includes income from operations, more than offset by the 
transaction and integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also 
included. The net impact related to Scott Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. 
Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining 
portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business and cathode battery 
technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), 
identity management business and tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business (both in the second 
quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on 
divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $26 million, or 
approximately 5 cents per diluted share. For the full year 2017, the year-on-year net pre-tax increase from divestitures 
was approximately $474 million, which is equivalent to a year-on-year increase of 61 cents per diluted share (primarily 
related to the identity management business). Additional discussion on divestitures is provided later within the 
“Divestitures and Strategic Investments” section. 

Operating income results include year-on-year incremental strategic investments that decreased pre-tax earnings by 
approximately $51 million and $413 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. These incremental 
strategic investments are comprised of 3M’s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and 
supply chain footprint. Additional discussion on strategic investments is provided later within the “Divestitures and 
Strategic Investments” section. 

In the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company’s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the 
Company increased its accruals. This incremental increase resulted in a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted 
share. Refer to Note 15 for more details. 

Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $3 million and $111 million 
year-on-year in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on 
tax rates. This had a minimal impact per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and is equivalent to a year-on-year 
decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year 2017.  

Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 declined 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent 
year-on-year, respectively, which benefited earnings per share. The Company purchased $504 million and $2.1 billion of 
its own stock in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.  

Other net interest decreased earnings per share for both fourth quarter and full year 2017, largely due to the loss on 
extinguishment of debt, higher U.S. average balances, and higher interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt 
resulted in a charge of $96 million, which contributed to a year-on-year decrease of 11 cents per diluted share for both 
the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Additionally, the portion of interest expense related to the financing costs of 

18 

acquiring Scott Safety, which was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 2 cents per diluted share, is included in the 
acquisitions and divestitures impact described above. 

As discussed in the section below, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of 
the TCJA, which was equivalent to a decrease of $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax 
rate for the fourth quarter 2017 was 68.6 percent, an increase of 40.4 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the 
impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 23.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.2 percentage 
points versus 2016. For the full year 2017, the effective tax rate was 35.5 percent, an increase of 7.2 percentage points 
versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in the full year 2017, a 
decrease of 2.9 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the fourth quarter and full year 2017 
change in tax rate was driven largely by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, favorable 
geographic mix and other items, as referenced in Note 9.  

Income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -  (non-
GAAP measures): 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted 
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the 
TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the 
measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC 
guidance. See additional information in Note 9. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 
the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item 
represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the 
effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The 
adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers 
these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that 
discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing 
underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by 
other companies.

For total year 2016, productivity and other increased earnings, helped by lower defined benefit pension and 
postretirement expenses, higher selling prices, lower raw material costs, and productivity benefits related to the fourth 
quarter 2015 restructuring. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset 
utilization.  

Acquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the 
acquisitions of Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures 
of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license 
plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of 
its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these 
acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to earnings per share in 2016, 
driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further 
discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts. 

Restructuring actions (included within incremental strategic investments in the preceding table) resulted in an after-tax 
charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016. 

Foreign exchange impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 
2016, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 
14 cents per diluted share for 2016.  

Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2016 declined 3 percent versus 2015, which benefited earnings per 
share. The benefits from share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, 
which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016.  

Higher average debt balances led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016. 

The income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax 
rate was driven by a number of factors as referenced in Note 9, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting 
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1).

From a business segment perspective, 3M achieved both total sales growth and organic local-currency sales growth 
(which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in all five business segments. Operating income margins were 
22.8 percent, with four of five business segments above 22 percent.

•

•

•

In Industrial, total sales increased 6.9 percent, or 3.9 percent on an organic local currency basis, with organic
sales growth in abrasives, automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive
aftermarket, and separation and purification. Organic sales declined in advanced materials. Operating income
margins were 19.4 percent, down 2.5 percentage points, with the decline driven by incremental strategic
investments and a fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of the temporary protective films business.
In Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 15.0 percent, or 10.7 percent on an organic local currency basis.
Organic sales grew in all businesses, led by personal safety, roofing granules, and transportation safety.
Operating income margins were 26.3 percent, up 6.1 percentage points, with 2.4 percentage points of this
increase driven by divestitures, partially offset by acquisitions and incremental strategic investments.
In Health Care, total sales increased 6.0 percent, or 3.1 percent on an organic local currency sales basis.
Organic sales grew in food safety, health information systems, medical consumables, and oral care. Organic
sales declined in drug delivery systems. Operating income margins were 31.5 percent, up 1.8 percentage points.
In Electronics and Energy, total sales increased 12.5 percent, or 11.0 percent on an organic local currency basis.
Electronics-related organic sales increased 14 percent, with growth in both electronics materials solutions and
display materials and systems. Energy-related organic sales increased 4 percent as growth in electrical markets
was partially offset by declines in telecommunications markets. Operating income margins were 25.2 percent,
down 2.5 percentage points. The fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of intellectual property and fourth quarter
2017 incremental strategic investments negatively impacted operating income margins by 3.3 percentage
points.

•

In Consumer, total sales increased 7.3 percent, or 5.4 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales
grew in consumer health care, home improvement, and stationery and office, while sales in home care were
flat. Operating income margins were 22.9 percent, up 2.0 percentage points.

In the Asia Pacific geographic area, where 3M’s Electronics and Energy business is concentrated, sales
benefited from strengthened demand across most electronics market segments in addition to strong growth in
3M’s Safety and Graphics business. In China/Hong Kong, total sales increased 21 percent and organic local-
currency sales increased 18 percent. In Japan, total sales increased 6 percent, as organic local-currency sales
growth of 7 percent was partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.
In the EMEA geographic area, Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa had total sales increase by 14
percent, with organic local-currency sales increases of 12 percent. West Europe total sales grew 18 percent,
driven by foreign currency translation impacts, in addition to organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent.
In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 7 percent in Mexico, driven by foreign
currency translation impacts, in addition to organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent. In Canada, total
sales increased 13 percent, driven by organic local-currency sales growth of 8 percent. In Brazil, total sales and
organic local-currency sales increased 3 percent.

Selling prices were up 0.2 percent year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in 
electronics had a negative impact on price. EMEA and Latin America/Canada had price growth, while U.S. selling prices 
declined slightly.

In the EMEA geographic area, Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa total sales and organic local-
currency grew 5 percent. West Europe total sales grew 5 percent, with organic local-currency sales growth of 3
percent along with an increase related to foreign currency translation.
In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 4 percent in Mexico, as organic local-
currency sales growth of 6 percent was partially offset by divestitures. In Canada, total sales increased 8
percent, with organic-local currency sales growth of 7 percent. In Brazil total sales growth of 9 percent was
driven by foreign currency translation, while organic local-currency sales increased 2 percent.

Foreign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.5 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in 
Latin America/Canada and EMEA partially offset by the decreases in Asia Pacific. Selling prices were flat year-on-year 
for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and 
EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.

2.7 percent in Latin America/Canada. Organic local-currency sales grew 3.7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.5 
percent in the United States, 0.4 percent in EMEA, and declined 2.8 percent in Asia Pacific. 

Financial condition: 

3M generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, a decrease of $422 million when compared to 2016. This 
followed an increase of $242 million when comparing 2016 to 2015. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition 
and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of 
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock. This program has no pre-
established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $3.8 
billion in 2016 and $5.2 billion in 2015. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion of its own stock in 
2018. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 
16 percent. This marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, 

25 

 

with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors 
Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding 
throughout business cycles. 
 
Raw materials:  
 
In 2017, the Company continued to manage year-on-year raw material input costs, benefiting from input management, 
reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material 
categories in oil-derivative chemical feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock 
categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company 
is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is 
difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided 
disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic 
relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend 
category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. 

Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans: 
 
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2017. The primary 
U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 94 percent 
funded and the international pension plans were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded 
due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2017 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 
12.4%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. 
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 
7.25%, consistent with 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2017 discount rate was 3.68%, down 
0.53 percentage points from the year-end 2016 discount rate of 4.21%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an 
increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status 
increased 4 percentage points in 2017 as strong plan assets returns and $800 million in contributions increased asset 
values in excess of the higher PBO due to the significant discount rate decline. Additional detail and discussion of 
international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans). 
 
3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and 
postretirement plans in 2018. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for 
its U.S. plans in 2018. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2018 (before 
settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $76 million pre-tax when 
compared to 2017. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement 
Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans. 
 
Divestitures and strategic investments: 
 
In both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, the Company continued to accelerate investments in growth initiatives 
and footprint optimization. In addition, the Company divested certain businesses as it continued to focus its portfolio on 
opportunities that create greater value for its shareholders. As shown below, these divestitures and strategic investments 
led to a net year-on-year decrease of approximately $0.01 per diluted share and a benefit of $0.10 per diluted share, 
respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:

2017 announced and 2018 closed divestitures: 
 
In December 2017, 3M announced it had reached an agreement to sell substantially all of its Communications Markets 
Division, which consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions, structured cabling solutions, and 
telecommunications system integration services. The business has annual global sales of approximately $400 million. 
The Company expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $500 million in 2018 as a result of this divestiture. 3M expects to 
realize a gain of approximately $0.40 per diluted share from this transaction, net of actions related to this divestiture. 
Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion. 
 
In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, 
environmental, and heat stress monitoring. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The transaction 
is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of less than $20 million that will be reported within the Company’s Safety and 
Graphics business. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
Net Sales: 
 
Refer to the preceding “Overview” section and the “Performance by Business Segment” section later in MD&A for 
additional discussion of sales change. 
 
Operating Expenses: 
 
 
(Percent of net sales) 
Cost of sales  
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Research, development and related expenses 
Gain on sale of businesses 
Operating income margin 
 
Operating income margins increased in 2017 versus 2016, driven by gains from sale of businesses, partially offset by 
cost of sales increases. A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost 
management, strategic investments, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement 
effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension 
and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and 
research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense 
increased $82 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of $305 million in 2016. Refer to Note 12 (Pension and 
Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost. 
 
The Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and 
internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency 
and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the 
ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. 
 
In 2017, as referenced above in the “Divestitures and strategic investments” section, 3M incurred $413 million in 
incremental strategic actions, primarily reported within the cost of sales and SG&A income statement line items. 
 
Of these strategic investments, 3M incurred $96 million (net of adjustments) in restructuring actions and $47 million in 
exit activities during 2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M incurred $114 million in restructuring charges. 
Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the impact to operating expenses. 
 
Cost of Sales: 
 
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.  
 
Cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, 
portfolio actions and footprint optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit 
pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing 
cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for the full year 2017. 
 
Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased in 2016 due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material 
cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 0.7 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by 
approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined 
benefit pension and postretirement costs. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-
year comparison. 

28 

 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: 
 
SG&A increased $350 million year-on year, or 5.6 percent, during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments and 
higher defined benefit pension expense. SG&A decreased $7 million, or 0.1 percent, in 2016 when compared to 2015, 
with 2016 results benefiting from foreign currency translation, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 
2015 restructuring. In addition, SG&A in 2016 benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. 
Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. 
 
Research, Development and Related Expenses: 
 
R&D increased $115 million year-on-year and decreased $28 million year-on-year in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M 
continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to 
create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2017, 
2016, and 2015. 
 
Gain on Sale of Businesses: 
 
In 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, completed the related sale or transfer of control, 
as applicable, of its identity management business, sold its tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and 
electronic monitoring businesses, and sold the assets of its electrical marking/labeling business. On a combined basis, 
these divestitures resulted in a gain on the sale of businesses of $586 million. 3M also divested certain businesses in 
2016 and 2015, resulting in gains of $111 million and $47 million, respectively. Refer to Note 2 for additional detail on 
these divestitures. 
 
Operating Income Margin: 
 
3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table 
below for a reconciliation of operating income margins for 2017 and 2016.

Current period 
 
Year 2017 and fourth quarter operating income: 
 
Operating income margins increased 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 0.7 percentage 
points for the full year 2017 when compared to the same periods last year. 3M benefited from higher organic local-
currency sales growth and productivity, partially offset by actuarial adjustments to the Company’s respirator 
mask/asbestos liability accrual. Acquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integration costs, net of 
income, that relate to the acquisition of Scott Safety, in addition to the year-on-year divestiture gains (refer to Note 2) 
and non-repeating operating losses from divested businesses, which combined, reduced operating margins in the fourth 
quarter of 2017 and benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017. Items that reduced operating margins 
were incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges related to 
3M’s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint. For full year 2017, the benefit from year-on-year 
divestiture gains and non-repeating net operating losses from divested businesses (primarily related to the sale of Identity

Management) was partially offset by the impact of the Scott Safety acquisition noted earlier. 3M also benefited from raw 
material sourcing cost reduction projects. Lastly, operating margins were reduced by foreign currency effects (net of 
hedge impacts) and higher year-on-year defined benefit pension expense.  
 
Year 2016 operating income: 
 
Operating income margins were 24.0 percent in 2016 compared to 22.9 percent in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage 
points. 3M benefited from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, plus lower year-on-year 
defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. Acquisitions and divestitures had a favorable impact on operating 
margins. This included solid performances from both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Divestiture impacts 
relate to the Polyfoam business, the library systems business, and the license plate converting business in France. In 
addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery 
technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments, as 
3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses. 
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume, productivity, and 
other decreased operating margins as a result of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and 
Energy businesses. Also, 3M had an unfavorable arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation 
settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. These 
declines within organic volume, productivity, and other were partially offset by 2015 restructuring charges, which 
provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, and productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring 
actions. 
 
Other Expense (Income), Net: 
 
See Note 5 for a detailed breakout of this line item. 
 
Interest expense increased during 2017 and 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. 
In addition, in October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its 
outstanding notes. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 
2017, which was included within interest expense. Capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment 
construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. Capitalized interest was $12 million, $10 million, 
and $13 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
Interest income increased year-on-year in both 2017 and 2016 due to higher average interest rates.  
 
Provision for Income Taxes: 
  
(Percent of pre-tax income) 
Effective tax rate  
 
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. 
The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. 
The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, “Income, earnings per share, and effective tax 
rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)” section and in Note 9. During 
the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. The 
expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and 
is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and 
certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year 
following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. 
 
The TCJA establishes new tax laws that will also affect 2018 and future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) 
reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of the base erosion anti-
abuse tax (BEAT), 3) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 4) a

general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) limitations on the use of 
foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability, 6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive 
compensation, and 7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA and 
other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The 
tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax 
laws, measurement period adjustment effects on the provisional items and remaining analyses to complete noted in Note 
9 related to the 2017 impact of the TCJA, employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such 
as the geographic mix of income before taxes. 
  
Refer to Note 9 for further discussion of income taxes. 
 
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: 
  
(Millions) 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  
 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M 
ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The amount primarily relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s 
effective ownership is 75 percent. 
 
Currency Effects: 
 
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $111 million 
and $127 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local 
currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the 
United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign 
currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased 
pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 13 in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities.  
 
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 
 
For a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M’s business segments, see Item 1, 
Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its 
businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes: 
 
Integration of former Renewable Energy Division 

     
 8   $ 

2015 

 

 

 

 

  
 8  

3M’s former Renewable Energy Division (RED) has been integrated into existing divisions within the 
Electronics and Energy business segment and Safety and Graphics business segment. 3M is committed to 
leadership in sustainability and to enabling the advancement of energy solutions into the future. Integrating 
RED’s offerings into larger divisions already serving these segments will provide increased scale and build on 
strength by leveraging 3M’s existing brands, go-to-market capabilities, and relationships to support growth 
objectives. 

 
Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division 

3M created the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division, which combined the former Automotive 
Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division, which were both within the Industrial 
business segment. Combining the strengths along with the deep industry knowledge of each business will 
enable this new division to utilize shared technology platforms and processes to deliver a broader set of 
innovative solutions, along with world-class quality and service to 3M’s customers. This combination will help 
accelerate the Company’s profitable growth and market relevance across the automotive, aerospace and 
commercial transportation industries.

Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting 

•  The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts. This 

improved alignment reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple businesses within 
3M, creating a better customer experience. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to 
business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which 
business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. The 
alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts changed the attribution of dual credit 
across 3M’s business segments.  

 
Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M 
manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health 
Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. 
 
Corporate and Unallocated: 
 
In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented 
separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 17. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of 
miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain 
insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and 
certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to 
allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to 
fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. 
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $80 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the 
first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the 
fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company’s 
actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit pension and 
postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017.  
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $77 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M’s defined 
benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 
when compared to 2015. In addition, the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) 
provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses 
related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements 
related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities.

systems and electronics materials solutions, as the businesses drove increased penetration on OEM platforms in 
addition to strengthened end-market demand in consumer electronics. 

•  Sales increased 1 percent in 3M’s energy-related businesses, as sales growth in electrical markets was partially 

offset by declines in telecommunications.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA 
 
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of 
performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are 
generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products 
or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. 
As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a 
particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information 
related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. 
 
Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: 
 
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product 
demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2017, 62% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, 
followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in 
manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major 
geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and 
sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows 
from Investing Activities.” 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As 
stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and 
postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, 
selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors. 
 
Legal Proceedings: 
 
The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability 
accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal 
proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance 
Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 15) for additional information 
about such estimates. 
 
Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 
 
3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees 
outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective 
January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance 
benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, in 
measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 
requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan

as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in 
which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ 
equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate 
and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair 
value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 12 
for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health 
care liabilities and expenses. 
 
Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, 
compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits 
that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company 
measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and 
discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, 
fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future 
benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the 
calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 
2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and 
other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield 
curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot 
rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot 
rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of 
the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in 
other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service 
and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve 
rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 
2016. 
 
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected 
return on plan assets, which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return 
expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension 
plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 7.25%, equal to 2017. Refer to Note 12 for 
information on how the 2017 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-
retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of 
return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.02% for 2018, 
compared to 5.16% for 2017. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and 
postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $333 million, up from 
$251 million in 2016. Defined benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special 
termination benefits and other) is anticipated to increase to approximately $409 million in 2018, an increase of $76 
million compared to 2017.

Asset Impairments: 
 
As of December 31, 2017, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.9 billion and net identifiable intangible assets 
totaled $2.9 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for 
which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets 
employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely 
monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be 
shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related 
asset group. 
 
Of the $2.9 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily 
Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to 
Note 2 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible 
assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, 
with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty 
rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the 
resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, 
and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017, no impairment was 
indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 15 
percent. 
 
3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is 
performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all 
goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to 
be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units 
correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. 
 
An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the 
estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting 
unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry 
groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and 
growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M 
uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for 
businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses 
discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to 
economic or other conditions. 
 
As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any 
product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine 
the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its 
assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that 
no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2017 annual impairment test and 
is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time. 
 
As of October 1, 2017, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 
percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, 
Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and 

41 

Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation 
Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 40 percent or 
more. 3M’s market value at both December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, was significantly in excess of its 
shareholders’ equity of approximately $12 billion. 
 
As discussed in Note 2, 3M announced the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets division, which is 
expected to close in 2018, which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately $270 million upon 
sale. 
 
In 2017, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows 
analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using 
projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other 
factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. 
 
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and 
capabilities, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and 
development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no 
goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2017, no goodwill impairment was 
indicated for any of the reporting units. 
 
Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic 
conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted 
average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2017, 
the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes 
between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed 
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) 
may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of 
the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 
2018 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. 
 
Income Taxes: 
 
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax 
regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations 
with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax 
audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the 
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will 
be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to 
record these liabilities (refer to Note 9 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of 
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution 
may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the 
Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense 
would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the 
liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no 
longer necessary. 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. 
subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly 
enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. As discussed in Note 9, this expense is a provisional amount and is subject to 
adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as 
provided by recent SEC guidance.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital 
markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M’s 
businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, 
capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by 
complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to 
capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. 
acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access 
international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For 
those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or 
intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 9 for further information on earnings considered to be 
reinvested indefinitely.  
 
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M 
believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the 
Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At 
December 31, 2017, there was approximately $745 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding. 
 
Total Debt: 
 
The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. 
Additionally, the Company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are 
reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from 
Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.  
 
The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. 
Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at 
year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign 
currency effects. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 
medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from 
debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section. 
 
Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration 
statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This 
replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M 
entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) 
of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which 
was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.  
 
As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive 
of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and the 2017 debt referenced above, is approximately $13.1 billion 
(utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with 
respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 11.  
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 
2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a 
provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total 
facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2017. Under the $3.75 billion credit 

43 

agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not 
less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four 
consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2017, 
this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed 
facilities, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding 
at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities. 
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: 
 
At December 31, 2017, 3M had $4.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately 
$3.975 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $180 million was held by the United 
States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 
2016, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and by the United 
States totaled approximately $2.35 billion and $350 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities 
investments are provided in Note 10. 
 
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure): 
 
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other 
companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term 
marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be 
important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016.

Balance Sheet: 
 
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous 
opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual 
review of acquisition opportunities. 
 
The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets. These 
measures include working capital, accounts receivable turns, and inventory turns.

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month 
depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company 
defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors 
as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. 

 

44 

 
Working capital increased $1.1 billion during 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Current asset balance 
changes increased working capital by $2.6 billion, driven by increases in cash/cash equivalents and marketable 
securities, in addition to higher accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance 
changes decreased working capital by $1.5 billion, largely due to increases in short-term borrowings, with commercial 
paper outstanding of $745 million at December 31, 2017 compared to none outstanding at December 31, 2016.  
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory Turns (non-GAAP measures): 
 
Accounts receivable and inventory turns are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may 
not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines accounts receivable turns as 
quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable – net, and defines inventory turns as quarterly 
manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory. 3M believes accounts receivable turns is meaningful to 
investors as a measure of how efficiently the Company manages credit and collects from its customers. For inventory 
turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs. 3M believes 
inventory turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how quickly inventory is sold. Details of these calculations 
follow.

Accounts receivable increased $519 million year-on-year in 2017, primarily due to increased sales. In addition, foreign 
currency impacts increased 2017 accounts receivable by $215 million and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased 
accounts receivable by $57 million. As a result, accounts receivable turns decreased 2 percent versus 2016. 
 
Inventory increased $649 million year-on-year in 2017. Foreign currency impacts increased 2017 inventory by $210 
million and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased inventory by $51 million. Higher fourth quarter sales contributed 
to a 10 percent increase in cost of sales, while inventory increased 19 percent, which combined contributed to an 8 
percent decrease in inventory turns. 
 
On a seasonal basis, both accounts receivable and inventory turns are historically higher at year-end, driven by lower 
year-end accounts receivable and inventory balances.

Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure): 
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC 
should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income 
(net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity 
plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The 
calculation is provided in the below table. 
 
In 2017, ROIC of 21.3 percent was lower than both 2016 and 2015. This decrease related to the net impact of the 
enactment of the TCJA and increases in commercial paper borrowings in conjunction with the December 2017 U.S. 
defined benefit pension plan contribution, which combined reduced ROIC by 3 percentage points in 2017.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax 
timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. 
 
In 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. 
Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in 
working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to 
a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts 
receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working 
capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) 
increased operating cash flows by $284 million. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in 
the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement 
contributions and expense is provided in Note 12, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations 
section. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2017 (discussed 
in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not 
operating activities. 
 
In 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $242 million compared to the same period in 2015, with 
this increase primarily due to lower year-on-year cash taxes and higher net income. These items were partially offset by 
higher Company pension contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable 
increased working capital by $108 million in 2016, compared to working capital increase of $46 million in 2015. Gain 
on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as 
cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating 
activities.

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product 
demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2018 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 
billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. 
 
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing 
current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other 
items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion 
of current facilities and new facilities, plus research facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as 
information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities. 
 
Investments included continued expansion and sustainment of current and new facilities across many geographies, 
focusing on growth, productivity and capacity. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, particularly the 
ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. Additional specific investments in 
2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story, 400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, 
Minnesota. 
 
Refer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional 
acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances to strengthen its portfolio, and from time to time may also divest certain 
businesses.  
 
Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2017 primarily includes the purchase of Scott Safety. In 2015, this amount 
consisted mostly of the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2017 primarily 
relate to the divestiture of the assets of the prescription safety eyewear, identity management, tolling and automated 
license/number plate recognition and electronic monitoring businesses within the Safety and Graphics business segment. 
Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2016 related to the divestiture of the assets of the pressurized polyurethane foam 
adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam) within the Industrial business segment and the completion of the 
divestiture of the Library business within the Safety and Graphics business segment. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 
2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business within the Industrial business segment and its cathode battery 
technology out-licensing business within the Electronics and Energy business segment.  
 
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and 
investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, 
and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Net proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable 
securities in 2015 were used to help fund the August 2015 acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana. Refer to Note 
10 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional 
survivor benefit insurance, plus cost method and equity investments.

2017 Debt Activity: 
 
The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. 
Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at 
year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset 
by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 
million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are 
largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also 
impacted debt balances. 
 
Proceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount 
of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal 
amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate 
principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to Note 11 for 
more detail of these debt issuances. 
 
In October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 
notes. This included $110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its 
$750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of 
$96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense associated with the differential between the carrying 
value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses. 
 
2016 Debt Activity: 
 
Total debt at December 31, 2016 increased $853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily 
due to May 2016 debt issuances (approximately $1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt 
issuances of approximately $1.75 billion. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate 
principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by 
international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8 million decrease), which is reflected in 
“Change in short-term debt—net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances. 
 
Proceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount 
of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro 
aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In 
September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 
2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes 
due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term 
notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program 
(Series F). 
 
2015 Debt Activity: 
 
In 2015, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan 
and Korea. Repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition. 
Proceeds from debt primarily related to the May 2015 issuance of 650 million Euros aggregate principal amount of five-
year floating rate medium-term notes due 2020, 600 million Euros aggregate principal amount of eight-year fixed rate 
medium-term notes due 2023, and 500 million Euros aggregate principal amount of fifteen-year fixed rate medium-term 
notes due 2030, which in the aggregate total approximately $1.9 billion at issue date exchange rates. In addition, August 
2015 issuances included $450 million aggregate principal amount of three-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2018, 
$500 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2020, and $550 million 
aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2025, which in aggregate total $1.5 billion.

Repurchases of Common Stock: 
 
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for 
other corporate purposes. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 
3M’s outstanding common stock. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased 
$2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $3.8 billion and $5.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 
Company expects full-year 2018 gross share repurchases to be between $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion. For more 
information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not 
utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock. 
 
Dividends Paid to Shareholders: 
 
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.803 billion ($4.70 per share) in 2017, $2.678 billion ($4.44 per share) in 
2016, and $2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of 
Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16 percent. This is equivalent to an 
annual dividend of $5.44 per share and marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
 
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, 
and principal payments for capital leases. In addition, in 2017, this included a payment related to the $96 million in 
interest expense associated with premiums and fees for the early retirement of debt. See Note 11 for additional details. 
 
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure): 
 
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with 
U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free 
cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be 
inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash 
flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and 
free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses 
these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each 
year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash 
flow and free cash flow conversion for 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
 
In 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension 
contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items 
benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating 
Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Cash 
Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital spending for property, plant and equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing 
arrangements. Refer to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 15 for discussion of accrued product 
warranty liabilities and guarantees. 
 
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the 
Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property 
damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products 
infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these indemnification 
provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Unconditional purchase obligations and other   
Total contractual cash obligations 
 
Long-term debt payments due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $54 million, $71 million, and 
$95 million, respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the 
election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 9, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during 
the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent 
SEC guidance. 
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and 
legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain 
obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates 
include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase 
obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M 
guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to 
receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital 
commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s 
expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the 
future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products 
and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not 
provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. 
 
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and 
other,” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid 
out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, 
other than the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which is separately included in the table

above, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net 
tax liability of $523 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 9 for further details. 
 
As discussed in Note 12, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its 
U.S. plans in 2018 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely 
discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange 
rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The 
Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the 
Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified 
intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional 
principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection 
agreements and commodity price swaps. 
 
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign 
exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. 
 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in 
earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, 
determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative 
instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and 
valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. 
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair 
value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals 
and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company 
does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 
 
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk: 
 
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to 
the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and 
option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign 
currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge 
relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M 
hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M 
enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the 
impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and 
intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward 
contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net 
investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.6 billion at 
December 31, 2017. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $5.0 billion at December 31, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 
2017, the Company had 4.4 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-

52 

derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 13 in the “Net Investment Hedges” 
section. 
 
Interest Rates Risk: 
 
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M 
manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter 
into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company 
agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by 
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency 
exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2017 was $2.0 billion. 
Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note 11, including references to information regarding 
derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 13, associated with the Company’s long-term debt. 
 
Commodity Prices Risk: 
 
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and 
commodity price swaps. 3M used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to 
manage price volatility, but discontinued this practice in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or 
loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost 
of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other 
commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and 
precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were 
outstanding at December 31, 2017 was not material. 
 
Value At Risk: 
 
The value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest 
rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings 
related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 
2017. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The 
exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity 
prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the 
Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would 
not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax 
earnings related to these exposures. 
 
 
 
(Millions) 
Foreign exchange rates

Commodity prices 
 
In addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange 
rates, recent historical information is as follows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging 
impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $111 million and $127 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This estimate 
includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the 
transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including 
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year 
derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 
million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one 
percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $75 million per year. The global energy

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America. Where necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment. 
 
Management has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its 
subsidiaries. This system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies 
and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared 
and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is supported by widely 
communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all employees to 
maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the accounting 
and control system.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial 
reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the 
framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control 
— Integrated Framework (2013). Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 excluded Scott Safety, which was acquired by the Company in October 
2017 in a purchase business combination. Scott Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales 
both represented less than 1 percent of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year 
ended December 31, 2017. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over 
financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines 
established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of 
December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is 
included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company 
 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 3M Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively 
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).   
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
Basis for Opinions 
 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is 
to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects.   
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing 
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinions. 
 
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Scott 
Safety from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 because it was acquired 
by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2017.  We have also excluded Scott Safety from our audit of 
internal control over financial reporting.  Scott Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales 
excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting both represent less 
than 1 percent of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
NOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Consolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of 
products. All subsidiaries are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” 
or “Company” refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 
Basis of presentation: Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to 
conform to the current year presentation. 
 
Foreign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United 
States. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of 
the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. 
Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in 
shareholders’ equity. 
 
3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which are remeasured under Accounting Standards 
Codification (ASC) 830, Foreign Currency Matters, as if its functional currency were that of its parent because 
Venezuela’s economic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary is 
immaterial as a percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2017. The Venezuelan government sets official rates 
of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local currency. The government 
also operates various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and replaced from 
time to time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the 
financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary 
auction mechanism, Tipo de Cambio Complementario, which was redesigned by the Venezuelan government in June 
2017 (DICOM2), or its predecessor. During the same periods, the Venezuelan government’s official exchange was Tipo 
de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of 
factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert 
currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular 
rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The Company 
continues to monitor these circumstances. Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange mechanisms may continue 
in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net monetary 
assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a balance of 
net monetary assets denominated in VEF of less than 10 billion VEF and the DIPRO and DICOM2 exchange rates were 
approximately 10 VEF and 3,300 VEF per U.S. dollar, respectively. 
 
A need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of 
VEF-denominated cash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to 
government regulations in Venezuela. 3M monitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; 
the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, 
purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela. 
Based upon a review of factors as of December 31, 2017, the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan 
subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this 
subsidiary was approximately $145 million and the amount of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its 
total equity balance were not significant. 
 
Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of 
three months or less when acquired. 

62 

 
Marketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost 
of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-
current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable 
securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, 
when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. A temporary 
impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a 
component of shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting 
period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary 
and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit 
quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other 
comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment. 
 
Investments: Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. 
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value at each reporting date and subject to ASC 320, as described 
above. 
 
Other assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender 
value of life insurance policies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that 
could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value 
during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life 
insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities 
and sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively. 
 
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out 
basis. 
 
Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct 
engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the 
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and 
improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The 
estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the 
range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in 
property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related 
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or 
credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is 
calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a 
discounted cash flow analysis. 

Conditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation 
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of 
fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The 
obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are 
accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful 
lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $106 million and $111 million at December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
Goodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth 
quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that 
would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, 

 

63 

with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are 
required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did 
not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which 
the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of a 
reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable 
industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors 
to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which 
is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments. 
 
Intangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other 
intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period 
ranging from one to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the 
asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer related largely between eight to seventeen years, 
patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between two to fifteen years, definite lived 
tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between two to ten years. Costs related 
to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in “Research, development 
and related expenses.” 
 
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The 
amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair 
value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 
 
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested for impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or 
circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally 
would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. 
 
Restructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance 
charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with 
such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and 
substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are 
estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected 
employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the 
date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ 
remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before 
the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will 
continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset 
impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ 
carrying values over their fair values. 

Revenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the 
world and has no material concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership 
have substantively transferred to customers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon 
performance of services. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and 
distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at the time of the initial sale. These sales incentives 
are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The estimated reductions of revenue for rebates 
are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets 
served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most 
common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth 
objectives. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Sales, use, value-added and other 
excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. 
 

 

64 

The vast majority of 3M’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring 
upon delivery of the product or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into agreements 
that involve multiple elements (such as equipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and 
conditions. 
 
For non-software multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they 
have stand-alone value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only 
customary refund or return rights. Arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling 
price method. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if 
available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is 
available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to establish the price to sell the 
deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded until the 
installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the 
functionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed. 
 
For arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not 
involve significant production, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is 
recognized when the Company has VSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have 
been met for the delivered elements. When the arrangements involve significant production, modification or 
customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional performance is employed. 
 
For prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless 
historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized 
as earned, and no revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term. 
 
On occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For 
these agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive 
milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred. 
 
Accounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear 
interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The 
allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical 
write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. The Company reviews the 
allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure 
related to its customers. 
 
Advertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $411 million in 
2017, $385 million in 2016 and $368 million in 2015. 
 
Research, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown 
on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.850 
billion in 2017, $1.735 billion in 2016 and $1.763 billion in 2015. Research and development expenses, covering basic 
scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their 
uses, totaled $1.335 billion in 2017, $1.225 billion in 2016 and $1.223 billion in 2015. Related expenses primarily 
include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure 
and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and 
development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as 
equity method effects and impairments. 
 
Internal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external 
software acquired for use as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven 
years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the 
software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases within 

65 

property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and 
equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts. 
 
Environmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not 
contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are 
recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the 
completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. 
Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized 
and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 
 
Income taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, 
deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax 
assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had 
valuation allowances of $81 million and $47 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The increase in valuation 
allowance at December 31, 2017 relates to certain U.S. and international jurisdictions with taxable loss or tax credit 
carryforwards that are expected to expire prior to utilization. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax 
positions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes. 
 
Earnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted 
earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s 
stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the 
years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M 
common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (0.8 million average options for 2017, 3.6 
million average options for 2016, and 5.0 million average options for 2015). The computations for basic and diluted 
earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, 
which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General 
Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based 
compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in 
which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes 
payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of 
the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than 
the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. Beginning in 2016, as 
a result of 3M’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based 
Payment Accounting, these excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the 
statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as 
other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock 
price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises. Prior to 2016, excess tax benefits were

recognized in additional paid-in capital within equity, and, with respect to statement of cash flows, were reflected as a 
financing cash inflow. Based on the adoption methodology of ASU No. 2016-09 applied, periods prior to 2016 were not 
changed. 

Comprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects 
(including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan 
adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses 
on cash flow hedging instruments. 
 
Derivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price 
swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange 
rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are 
designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying 
hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are 
recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes 
recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in 
the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge 
relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a 
party to leveraged derivatives. 
 
Credit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate 
swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is 
limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of 
credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 
3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative 
transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity 
and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate 
nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and 
liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are 
subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. 
 
Fair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and 
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is 
defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs 
used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs 
by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants 
would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the 
Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants 
would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The 
hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices 
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or 
liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement. 
 
Acquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. 
This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among 

67 

other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including 
contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition 
accounting. 
 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard as to effective date. The ASU 
provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers 
and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard’s stated 
core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying 
the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, 
allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a 
performance obligation. The standard also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a 
customer and requires expanded disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows 
arising from contracts with customers. During 2016, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent 
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net); ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and 
Licensing; ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical 
Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which amend ASU No. 2014-09. 
These amendments include clarification of principal versus agent guidance in situations in which a revenue transaction 
involves a third party in providing goods or services to a customer. In such circumstances, an entity must determine 
whether the nature of its promise to the customer is to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the 
principal in the transaction) or to arrange for the third party to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is 
the agent in the transaction). The amendments clarify, in terms of identifying performance obligations, how entities 
would determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable from other promises in a contract and, 
therefore, would be accounted for separately. The guidance allows entities to disregard goods or services that are 
immaterial in the context of a contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling 
activities as fulfillment costs rather than as additional promised services. With regard to licensing, the amendments 
clarify how an entity would evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which 
determines whether the entity recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. The amendments also address 
implementation issues relative to transition (adding a practical expedient for contract modifications and clarifying what 
constitutes a completed contract when employing full or modified retrospective transition methods), collectability, 
noncash consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar-type taxes (allowing entities to exclude sales-type 
taxes collected from transaction price). Finally, the amendments provide additional guidance in the areas of disclosure of 
performance obligations, provisions for losses on certain types of contracts, scoping, and other areas. Overall, ASU No. 
2014-09, as amended, provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified retrospective adoption by which it is 
applied only to the most current period presented. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2018 and the Company has 
concluded that it will utilize the modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company has completed analyses, 
executed project management relative to the process of adopting this ASU, and conducted detailed contract reviews to 
complete necessary adjustments to existing accounting policies and quantify the ASU’s effect. For most of 3M’s revenue 
arrangements, there are no impacts as these transactions are not accounted for under industry-specific guidance that will 
be superseded by the ASU and generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or 
services. 3M also engages in some arrangements for which software industry-specific guidance (which the ASU 
supersedes) is presently utilized. The Company also considered these arrangements in the detailed contract reviews that 
have been conducted. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2014-09, it does not expect 
this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes 
guidance related to both the variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With 
respect to the VIE model, the standard changes, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated 
with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the VIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and 
the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the ASU eliminates the presumption that a 

68 

general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise be overcome. Under 
the new guidance, a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model. 
The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. Because 3M did not have significant involvement with 
entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships 
potentially impacted by the VOE model changes, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement, 
which requires a customer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the 
arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for fees related to the software license element in a 
manner consistent with accounting for the acquisition of other acquired software licenses. If the arrangement does not 
contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. An arrangement would 
contain a software license element if both (1) the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at 
any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either run the 
software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. 3M adopted this 
ASU prospectively to arrangements entered into, or materially modified beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption did not 
have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing 
requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount 
requires consideration of replacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit 
margin. The new ASU replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, 
less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and 
consider replacement cost or NRV less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. 3M adopted 
this standard prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on 3M’s 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities, which revises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity 
securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU 
also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new guidance 
requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other ownership interests in an entity, 
including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies (collectively, equity 
securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to 
measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize 
unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other 
comprehensive income (OCI). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities 
that do not have readily determinable fair values. Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise 
qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be permitted to elect a practicability exception and 
measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly transactions). The 
ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value 
changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity 
would be required to separately present in OCI the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-
specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not apply to derivative 
instruments required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this 
standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018 via a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except 
for guidance relative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. Because 
the Company has historically held limited amounts of equity securities (less than $75 million in aggregate at December 
31, 2017), and has not elected the FVO with respect to material financial liabilities, it does not expect this standard to 
have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new 
standard introduces a lessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but 
recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make 

69 

fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct 
financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue 
standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can 
be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and 
quantitative disclosures. The standard requires modified retrospective transition by which it is applied at the beginning of 
the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. 
Information under existing lease guidance with respect to rent expense for operating leases and the Company’s minimum 
lease payments for capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess one year as of December 31, 2017 is 
included in Note 15. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments. This ASU 
clarifies guidance used to determine if debt instruments that contain contingent put or call options would require 
separation of the embedded put or call feature from the debt instrument and trigger accounting for the feature as a 
derivative with changes in fair value recorded through income. Under the new guidance, fewer put or call options 
embedded in debt instruments would require derivative accounting. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2017. 
The Company’s outstanding debt with embedded put provisions did not require separate derivative accounting under 
existing guidance. As a result, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, 
which eliminates the existing requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively (revising prior 
periods as if the equity method had always been applied) when an entity obtains significant influence over a previously 
held investment. The new guidance would require the investor to apply the equity method prospectively from the date 
the investment qualifies for the equity method. The investor would add the carrying value of the existing investment to 
the cost of any additional investment to determine the initial cost basis of the equity method investment. For 3M, this 
ASU was effective January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis. 3M will apply this guidance to investments that transition to 
the equity method after the adoption date. 
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which 
revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope. The new standard 
introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and 
modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses 
(referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and 
certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments 
in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU 
amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such securities with unrealized losses, entities will still 
consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction in income. 
However, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of 
that AFS debt security, the ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain 
circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. 
For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to apply the 
standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting 
period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated 
result of operations and financial condition. 
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which 
is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the 
statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of 
zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement 
of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for 
classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The Company early 
adopted ASU No. 2016-15 as of January 1, 2017. Since the associated changes in classification were immaterial to all 

70 

prior periods presented, no impact was reflected in the Company’s pre-2017 consolidated results of operations and 
financial condition presented. 
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which 
modifies existing guidance and is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income 
tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets. The ASU indicates that the current exception to income tax 
accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax effects of certain intercompany transactions would apply only 
to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers 
of other assets (e.g., intangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense associated with intra-entity 
profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is eliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and 
recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated group. Similarly, the entity 
is prohibited from recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. 
For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018. The standard requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative 
catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Upon adoption, a company would write off 
any income tax effects that had been deferred from past intercompany transactions involving non-inventory assets to 
opening retained earnings. In addition, an entity would record deferred tax assets with an offset to opening retained 
earnings for amounts that entity had previously not recognized under existing guidance but would recognize under the 
new guidance. Based on deferred tax amounts related to applicable past intercompany transactions as of December 31, 
2017, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and 
financial condition. 
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common 
Control, which modifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a 
variable interest entity (VIE) through a common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the 
VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to be consolidated. Under the ASU, a decision maker would 
need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party. Previous 
guidance had required the decision maker to treat the common control party’s interest in the VIE as if the decision maker 
held the interest itself. As a result of the ASU, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change. For 3M, 
the standard was effective January 1, 2017 with retrospective application to January 1, 2016. 3M does not have 
significant involvement with entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by VIE model factors. As a result, 
the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and 
financial condition. 
 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which clarifies guidance on the classification 
and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, changes in restricted cash and 
restricted cash equivalents would be included along with those of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash 
flows. As a result, entities would no longer present transfers between cash/equivalents and restricted cash/equivalents in 
the statement of cash flows. In addition, a reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows 
would be disclosed when the balance sheet includes more than one line item for cash/equivalents and restricted 
cash/equivalents. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-18 as of January 1, 2017. Due to the immaterial use of 
restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, no impact was reflected in the Company’s pre-2017 consolidated results 
of operations and financial condition presented. 
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which narrows the existing 
definition of a business and provides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an 
acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. The ASU requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair 
value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if 
so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a business. To be considered a business, the set 
would need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create 
outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of outputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such 
as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets are expected to be considered 
businesses. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. 3M 
would apply this guidance to applicable transactions after the adoption date. 
 

71 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under the new 
standard, goodwill impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its 
fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to 
determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair 
value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business 
combination. For 3M, this ASU is effective prospectively to impairment tests beginning January 1, 2020, with early 
adoption permitted. 3M adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2017 in conjunction with its annual goodwill 
impairment testing. The adoption did not have an impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial 
condition. 
 
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and 
Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the 
FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new standard 
clarifies the accounting for derecognition of nonfinancial assets and defines what is considered an in substance 
nonfinancial asset. Nonfinancial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and intellectual property that do 
not constitute a business. The new ASU impacts entities derecognizing (e.g. selling) nonfinancial assets (or in substance 
nonfinancial assets), including partial interests therein, when the purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, 
the seller would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers, even though the purchaser is not a customer. For 3M, this new standard is effective coincident with the 
Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material 
impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net 
Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or 
other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, 
only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and only the 
service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic benefit 
costs components (such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss 
amortization) would be reported outside of operating income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a 
retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component is applied on 
prospective basis. The components of 3M’s net periodic defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit costs are 
presented in Note 12. These include components totaling a benefit of $129 million, $195 million, and a detriment of $34 
million, for the fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, that would no longer be included within operating 
expenses and instead would be reported outside of income from operations under the new standard. Further, the 
capitalization of service cost change is not expected to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, 
which amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under existing 
standards, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life of the instrument. 
The new guidance shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt securities that have 
explicit, noncontingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. The amendments do not require an 
accounting change for securities held at a discount. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019 with a modified 
retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first 
reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Early adoption is permitted. 3M’s marketable security portfolio 
includes very limited instances of callable debt securities held at a premium. As a result, the Company does not expect 
this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the 
terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The general model for 
accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards is to record the incremental value arising from the changes 
as additional compensation cost. Under the new standard, fewer changes to the terms of an award would require 
accounting under this modification model. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. 
Because the Company does not typically make changes to the terms or conditions of its issued share-based payment 

72 

awards, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial 
condition. 
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-10, Determining the Customer of the Operation Services, that clarifies 
how an operating entity determines the customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of a service 
concession arrangement. Service concession arrangements are typically agreements between a grantor and an operating 
entity whereby the operating entity will operate the grantor’s infrastructure (i.e. airports, roadways, bridges, and prisons) 
for a specified period of time. The operating entity also may be required to maintain the infrastructure and provide 
capital-intensive maintenance to enhance or extend its life. In such arrangements, typically the operation services (i.e. 
operation and maintenance of a roadway) would be used by third parties (i.e. drivers). The ASU clarifies that the grantor, 
not the third party, is the customer of the operation services in such arrangements. For 3M, this new standard is effective 
coincident with the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Because the Company is not typically a 
party to agreements within the scope of accounting for service concession arrangements, 3M does not expect this ASU to 
have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down 
Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of 
Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. The 
new standard applies to issuers of financial instruments with down-round features. A down-round provision is a term in 
an equity-linked financial instrument (i.e. a freestanding warrant contract or an equity conversion feature embedded 
within a host debt or equity contract) that triggers a downward adjustment to the instrument’s strike price (or conversion 
price) if equity shares are issued at a lower price (or equity-linked financial instruments are issued at a lower strike price) 
than the instrument’s then-current strike price. The purpose of the feature is typically to protect the instrument’s 
counterparty from future issuances of equity shares at a more favorable price. The ASU amends (1) the classification of 
such instruments as liabilities or equity by revising the certain guidance relative to evaluating if they must be accounted 
for as derivative instruments and (2) the guidance on recognition and measurement of freestanding equity-classified 
instruments. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Because the Company has not 
issued financial instruments with down-round features, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The 
ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow companies 
to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain 
requirements for an instrument to qualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge 
effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge relationship is highly effective would still be 
required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative test and 
expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by 
eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and 
net investment hedges, the entire change in fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be 
recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line that is used 
to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges, generally, 
the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as 
the hedged item. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands 
an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. In addition, the guidance also eases certain 
documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU 
is effective January 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded 
to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is 
currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

NOTE 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 
Acquisitions: 
 
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, 
among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business 
combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise 
after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses. 
 
In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases 
interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions 
are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity. 
 
2017 acquisitions: 
 
In September 2017, 3M purchased all of the ownership interests of Elution Technologies, LLC, a Vermont-based 
manufacturer of test kits that help enable food and beverage companies ensure their products are free from certain 
potentially harmful allergens such as peanuts, soy or milk. Elution is reported within the Company’s Health Care 
business. 
 
In October 2017, 3M completed the acquisition of the underlying legal entities and associated assets of Scott Safety, 
which is headquartered in Monroe, North Carolina, from Johnson Controls for $2.0 billion of cash, net of cash acquired. 
Scott Safety is a premier manufacturer of innovative products, including self-contained breathing apparatus systems, gas 
and flame detection instruments, and other safety devices that complement 3M’s personal safety portfolio. The business 
had revenues of approximately $570 million in 2016. Scott Safety is reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. 
The allocation of purchase consideration related to Scott Safety is considered preliminary with provisional amounts 
primarily related to intangible assets and certain tax-related, contingent liability and working capital items. 3M expects to 
finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one year measurement-period following the acquisition.  
 
Pro forma information related to acquisitions has not been included because the impact on the Company’s consolidated 
results of operations was not considered material. The following table shows the impact on the consolidated balance 
sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2017 acquisitions and assigned finite-lived intangible asset weighted-
average lives.

Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2017 totaled $855 million. The 
associated finite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2017 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally 
straight line) over a weighted-average life of 15 years (lives ranging from four to 17 years). Acquired in-process research 
and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying 
arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material. 
 
2016 acquisitions: 
 
In September 2016, 3M acquired all of the outstanding shares of Semfinder, headquartered in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. 
Semfinder is a leading developer of precision software that enables efficient coding of medical procedures in multiple 
languages. The purchase price paid for these business combinations (net of cash acquired) during 2016 aggregated to $16 
million. Semfinder is reported within 3M’s Health Care business.  
 
Adjustments in 2016 to the preliminary purchase price allocations of other acquisitions within the allocation period 
primarily related to the identification of contingent liabilities and certain tax-related items aggregating to approximately 
$35 million along with other balances related to the 2015 acquisition of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. The change to 
provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations in the third quarter of 2016, a portion of 
which related to earlier quarters in the measurement period. 
 
Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2016 totaled $4 million. The 
associated finite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2016 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally 
straight line) over a weighted-average life of 8 years (lives ranging from two to 20 years). Acquired in-process research 
and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying 
arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material. 
 
2015 acquisitions: 
 
In March 2015, 3M purchased all of the outstanding shares of Ivera Medical Corp., headquartered in San Diego, 
California. Ivera Medical Corp. is a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices used for 
access into a patient’s bloodstream and is reported within 3M’s Health Care business. In addition, in the first quarter of

2015, 3M purchased the remaining interest in a former equity method investment reported within 3M’s Industrial 
business for an immaterial amount. 
 
In August 2015, 3M acquired all of the outstanding shares of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L., with operating headquarters 
in Bloomington, Minnesota, from KKR & Co. L.P. for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The net assets acquired 
included the assumption of $0.8 billion of debt. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment 
and is reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. 
 
In August 2015, 3M acquired the assets and liabilities associated with Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media 
business (hereafter referred to as Membrana), headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, for $1.0 billion. Membrana is a 
leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty 
segments and is reported within 3M’s Industrial business. 
 
The impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2015 acquisitions and assigned 
weighted-average intangible asset lives, including adjustments relative to other acquisitions within the measurement 
period, follows. Adjustments in 2015 to the preliminary allocations primarily related to the identification and valuation 
of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. The change to provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial impact to 
results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015, a portion of which relates to earlier quarters in the measurement 
period.

Divestitures: 
 
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among 
other items, factors relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital 
deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and 
for shareholders. 
  
In January 2015, 3M completed the sale of its global Static Control business to Desco Industries Inc., based in Chino, 
California. 2014 sales of this business were $46 million. This transaction was not considered material and was reported 
within 3M’s Electronics and Energy business. 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M entered into agreements with One Equity Partners Capital Advisors L.P. (OEP) to sell 
the assets of 3M’s library systems business. The sales of the North American business and the majority of the business 
outside of North America closed in October and November 2015, respectively. The sale of the remainder of the library 
systems business closed in the first quarter of 2016 (discussed further below). In December 2015, 3M also completed the 
sale of Faab Fabricauto, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M, to Hills Numberplates Limited. The library systems business, 
part of the former Traffic Safety and Security Division, delivers circulation management solutions to library customers 
with on-premise hardware and software, maintenance and service, and an emerging cloud-based digital lending platform. 
Faab Fabricauto, also part of the former Traffic Safety and Security Division, is a leading French manufacturer of license 
plates and signage solutions. The aggregate cash proceeds relative to the 2015 global library systems and Faab 
Fabricauto divestiture transactions was $104 million. The Company recorded within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business 
a net pre-tax gain of $40 million in 2015 as a result of the sale and any adjustment of carrying value. 
 
In the first quarter of 2016, 3M completed the sale of the remainder of the assets of 3M’s library systems business to One 
Equity Partners Capital Advisors L.P. (OEP). 3M had previously sold the North American business and the majority of 
the business outside of North America to OEP in the fourth quarter of 2015 which was reported within 3M’s Safety and 
Graphics business. Also in the first quarter of 2016, 3M sold to Innovative Chemical Products Group, a portfolio 
company of Audax Private Equity, the assets of 3M’s pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly 
known as Polyfoam). This business is a provider of pressurized polyurethane foam adhesive formulations and systems 
into the residential roofing, commercial roofing and insulation and industrial foam segments in the United States with 
annual sales of approximately $20 million and was reported within 3M’s Industrial business. The Company recorded a 
pre-tax gain of $40 million in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the sales of these businesses.  
 
In October 2016, 3M sold the assets of its temporary protective films business to Pregis LLC. This business, with annual 
sales of approximately $50 million, is a provider of adhesive-backed temporary protective films used in a broad range of 
industries and was reported within 3M’s Industrial business. In December 2016, 3M sold the assets of its cathode battery 
technology out-licensing business, with annual sales of approximately $10 million, to UMICORE. This business was 
reported within 3M’s Electronics and Energy business. The aggregate selling price relative to these two businesses was 
$86 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the sales of 
these businesses.  
 
In January 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, with annual sales of approximately $45 
million, to HOYA Vision Care. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $29 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a 
result of this sale, which was reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.  
 
In May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable, of its identity management business to 
Gemalto N.V. This business, with 2016 sales of approximately $205 million, is a leading provider in identity 
management solutions, including biometric hardware and software that enable identity verification and authentication, as 
well as secure materials and document readers. In June 2017, 3M also completed the sale of its tolling and automated 
license/number plate recognition business, with annual sales of approximately $40 million, to Neology, Inc. 3M’s tolling 
and automated license/number plate recognition business includes RFID readers and tags, automatic vehicle 

77 

classification systems, lane controller and host software, and back office software and services. It also provides mobile 
and fixed cameras, software, and services in automated license/number plate recognition. 3M received proceeds of $833 
million, or $809 million net of cash sold, and reflected a pre-tax gain of $458 million as a result of these two divestitures, 
which was reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.  

In October 2017, 3M sold its electronic monitoring business to an affiliate of Apax Partners. This business, with annual 
sales of approximately $95 million, is a provider of electronic monitoring technologies, serving hundreds of correctional 
and law enforcement agencies around the world. 3M received proceeds of $201 million, net of cash sold, and reflected a 
pre-tax gain of $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of this divestiture, which was reported within the 
Company’s Safety and Graphics business. 

In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M sold the assets of an electrical marking/labeling business within its Electronics and 
Energy business. The former activity, proceeds and gain were not considered material. 

In December 2017, 3M agreed to sell substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated, 
for $900 million, subject to closing and other adjustments. This business, with annual sales of approximately $400 
million consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 
3M’s xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration 
services. This sale is expected to close in 2018, subject to consultation or information requirements with relevant works 
councils and to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. 3M expects a pre-tax gain of approximately 
$500 million as a result of this divestiture that will be reported within the Company’s Electronics and Energy business. 

In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, 
environmental, and heat stress monitoring to TSI, Inc. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The 
transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of less than $20 million that will be reported within the Company’s 
Safety and Graphics business. 

The aggregate operating income of these businesses was approximately $45 million, $50 million and not significant in 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The approximate amounts of major assets and liabilities associated with disposal 
groups classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included the following: 

(Millions) 
Accounts receivable 
Property, plant and equipment (net)

In addition, approximately $270 million of goodwill was estimated to be attributable to disposal groups classified as 
held-for-sale as of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, based upon relative fair value. The amounts above 
have not been segregated and are classified within the existing corresponding line items on the Company’s consolidated

NOTE 3.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 
Purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $1.3 billion in 2017, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. 
Purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $14 million in 2016, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The 
acquisition activity in the following table also includes the net impact of adjustments to the preliminary allocation of 
purchase price within the one year measurement-period following prior acquisitions, which increased goodwill by $39 
million during 2016. The amounts in the “Translation and other” column in the following table primarily relate to 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The goodwill balance by business segment follows:

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain 
circumstances such as a change in reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a 
reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 
 
As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its 
continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. For any product changes that 
resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on 
goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of 
any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment 
existed. The Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 for all reporting 
units and determined that no impairment existed. In addition, the Company had no impairments of goodwill in prior 
years.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for 
federal (approximately $7 million), state (approximately $12 million), and international (approximately $70 million), 
with all amounts net before valuation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the 
state after 5 to 10 years, and the international after one to three years or have an indefinite carryover period. The tax 
attributes being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain 
losses without the same type of taxable income. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has provided $81 million of 
valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-
likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.

 28.3 %   

 
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points, 
impacted by several factors. Primary factors that increased the Company’s effective tax rate included the impacts due to 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) being enacted in 2017 (see further information below) and remeasurements and 
establishment of 3M’s uncertain tax positions. Combined, these factors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 
12.1 percentage points. The increase was partially offset by a 4.9 percentage point decrease, which related to 
international taxes that were impacted by increasing benefits from the Company’s supply chain centers of expertise, 
changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and prior year cash optimization actions, higher year-on-year 
excess tax benefit for employee share-based payment, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, a reduction of state 
taxes, and other items. 
 
The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points, 
impacted by several factors. Primary factors that decreased the Company’s effective tax rate included the recognition of 
excess tax benefits beginning in 2016 related to employee share-based payments (resulting from the adoption of ASU 
No. 2016-09, as discussed in Note 1) and a reduction in state taxes. Combined, these factors decreased the Company’s 
effective tax rate by 3.2 percentage points. The decrease was partially offset by a 2.4 percentage point increase, which 
related to remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions and international taxes that were impacted by changes to both 
the geographic mix of income before taxes and additional tax expense related to global cash optimization actions. 
 
The TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate 
from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously 
unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign 
sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provides guidance on accounting 
for enactment effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the TCJA’s 
enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent 
that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA is incomplete but it is able to determine a 
reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a 
provisional estimate to be included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the 
provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the TCJA. 
 
In connection with 3M’s initial analysis of the impact of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax 
expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For various reasons that are discussed more fully below, including 

87 

the issuance of additional technical and interpretive guidance, 3M has not completed its accounting for the income tax 
effects of certain elements of the TCJA. However, with respect to the following, 3M was able to make reasonable 
estimates of the TCJA’s effects and, as such, recorded provisional amounts: 
 
Transition tax: The transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (E&P) of 
certain of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the transition tax, 3M must determine, in 
addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. 
income taxes paid on such earnings. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in 
cash and other specified assets. 3M was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a 
provisional obligation and additional income tax expense of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, the 
Company is continuing to gather additional information and will consider additional technical guidance to more 
precisely compute and account for the amount of the transition tax. This amount may change when 3M finalizes the 
calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in 
cash or other specified assets. The TCJA’s transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 
31, 2017, 3M reflected $122 million and $623 million in current accrued income taxes and long term income taxes 
payable, respectively. 
 
Remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and 
liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the 
TCJA. 3M is still analyzing certain aspects of the TCJA, considering additional technical guidance, and refining its 
calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred 
tax amounts. This includes the potential impacts of the global low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision within the TCJA 
on deferred tax assets/liabilities. 3M also is considering other impacts of the 2017 enactment of the TCJA including, but 
not limited to effects on the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion. As discussed further below in this Note 9, 3M 
previously has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been 
considered to be reinvested indefinitely. The full effects of underlying tax rates of the TCJA causes some reassessment 
of previous indefinite reinvestment assertions with respect to certain jurisdictions. While 3M was able to make a 
reasonable estimate of these impacts, it may be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA, including, but not limited 
to, the calculation of the transition tax on deferred foreign income. The provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter 
of 2017 related to deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts was a net additional income tax expense of $17 
million. 
 
3M has not completed its full analysis with respect to the GILTI provision within the TCJA and is not yet able to make 
reasonable estimates of its related effects. Therefore, no provisional adjustments relative to GILTI were recorded. 
Currently, 3M has not yet elected a policy as to whether it will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to 
reverse as GILTI or whether 3M will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred. 3M is not aware of other 
elements of the TCJA for which the Company was not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the enactment impact 
and for which it would continue accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect 
before the TCJA. 
 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With 
few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations 
by tax authorities for years before 2005. 
 
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 
through 2014. The Company protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative 
appeals process with the IRS. In December 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 
year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the first quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year. 
  
Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2015, 2016, 
and 2017. It is anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2015 by the end of the third 
quarter of 2018, for 2016 by the end of the first quarter of 2018, and for 2017 by the end of the first quarter of 2019. As 
of December 31, 2017, the IRS has not proposed any significant adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which 
the Company is not adequately reserved.

Payments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2017 examinations may not be made 
until a final agreement is reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution 
resulting from the administrative appeals process or judicial action. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is 
also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. 
  
3M anticipates changes to the Company’s uncertain tax positions due to the closing and resolution of audit issues for 
various audit years mentioned above and closure of statutes. Currently, the Company is estimating a decrease in 
unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months as a result of anticipated resolutions of audit issues. 
 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows: 
 
Federal, State and Foreign Tax 
  
(Millions) 
Gross UTB Balance at January 1 
 
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 
Additions for tax positions of prior years 
Reductions for tax positions of prior years 
Settlements 
Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations 
 
Gross UTB Balance at December 31 
 
Net UTB impacting the effective tax rate at December 31 
 
The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $526 million as of December 31, 2017, 
$333 million as of December 31, 2016, and $369 million as of December 31, 2015. The ending net UTB results from 
adjusting the gross balance for items such as Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and 
deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities 
within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The 
Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $20 million of expense, 
$10 million of expense, and $2 million of expense in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The amount of interest and 
penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At 
December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross 
basis were $68 million and $52 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and 
penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty 
about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and 
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would 
accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. 
 
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain 
manufacturing activities in the following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax 
for years through the following: Thailand (2018), China (2019), Korea (2019), Switzerland (2023), Singapore (2025), 
and Brazil (2073). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $228 
million (37 cents per diluted share) in 2017, $142 million (23 cents per diluted share) in 2016, and $114 million (18 cents 
per diluted share) in 2015. 
 
The Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have 
been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. As noted above, the effects of the TCJA caused some reassessment of 
previous indefinite reinvestment assertions with respect to certain jurisdictions. While 3M was able to make a reasonable 
estimate of these impacts, it may be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA. The unremitted earnings relate to

ongoing operations and were approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2017. Because of the multiple avenues in 
which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not 
practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

3M has a diversified marketable securities portfolio. Within this portfolio, asset-backed securities primarily include 
interests in automobile loans, credit cards and other asset-backed securities. 3M’s investment policy allows investments 
in asset-backed securities with minimum credit ratings of Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA- by Standard & 
Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must be rated by at least two of the aforementioned rating 
agencies, one of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At December 31, 2017, all asset-
backed security investments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 90 percent of all asset-backed security 
investments were rated AAA or A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or 
AAA or F1+ by Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value 
of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the 
nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. 3M does not

NOTE 11.  Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings 
 
The following debt tables reflect effective interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, as of 
December 31, 2017. If the debt was issued on a combined basis, the debt has been separated to show the impact of the 
fixed versus floating effective interest rates. Carrying value includes the impact of debt issuance costs and fair value 
hedging activity. Long-term debt and short-term borrowings as of December 31 consisted of the following:

Long-term debt payments due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $54 million (classified as 
current portion of long-term debt), $71 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table), and $95 
million (included within the long-term debt table), respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt 
instruments. 
 
Credit Facilities 
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 
2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a 
provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total 
facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2017. Under the $3.75 billion 
credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at 
not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the 
four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 
2017, this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. 
 
Other Credit Facilities 
 
Apart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank 
guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with 
normal business activities.

Long-Term Debt Issuances 
 
The principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-
term debt table found at the beginning of this note. 
 
In October 2017, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 
with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 
with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 
2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. 
 
In May 2016, 3M issued 1 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In September 2016, 3M 
issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. 
 
In May 2015, 3M issued 1.750 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In August 2015, 3M 
issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into 
two interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first 
converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note, and the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note 
included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index. 
 
Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments 
 
In June 2017, 3M repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes that matured. 
 
In October 2017, 3M, via cash tender offers, repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 
notes. This included $110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its 
$750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of 
approximately $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense, the cash outflow for which is recorded 
within other financing activities on the statement of cash flows. This charge reflected the differential between the 
carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses. 
 
In September 2016, 3M repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. 
 
Floating Rate Notes 
 
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these 
securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for 
each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating 
LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of 
par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due 
in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third 
anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods 
presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes. 

NOTE 12.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 
 
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the 
United States. In total, 3M has over 75 defined benefit plans in 27 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans 
generally are based on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The 
primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also 
provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age 
while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international 
employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement 
health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow. 
 

 

93 

The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with 
insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no 
plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit 
plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee. 
 
3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has 
a significant credit balance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act 
funding requirements. 
 
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are 
offered to substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 
401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the 
plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for 
employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account 
cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of 
investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans 
were $159 million, $139 million and $165 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various 
international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined 
contribution plans were $88 million, $87 million and $77 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
As a result of changes made to its U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans in 2010, the Company has transitioned all 
current and future retirees to a savings account benefits-based plan. These changes became effective beginning 
January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible retirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning 
January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and their eligible dependents. In August 2015, 3M modified the 
3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the future benefit for participants not retired as 
of January 1, 2016. For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, the Retiree Medical Savings Account (RMSA) is no 
longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement 
Arrangement is reduced from 3 percent to 1.5 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). 
Also effective January 1, 2016, 3M no longer offers 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires.  
 
3M was informed in 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold limited 
partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC 
(Commodity Futures Trading Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and six other limited partners of 
WG Trading Company, the district court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan 
(and in April 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). The 
benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests were adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair 
market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement dates. In the first quarter of 2014, 
3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit that was removed by the insurers to the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Minnesota against five insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In 
September 2015, the court ruled in favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and 
dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and the 3M benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In May 2017, the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s decision. The decision 
reduced U.S. pension and postretirement plan assets by $73 million at the December 31, 2017 measurement date and did 
not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. 
 
As part of a diversified investment strategy, the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans made investments in the 
natural gas fired power generation industry during the period 2011 through 2013. In April 2017, one of these entities, 
Panda Temple Power, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of 
Delaware. This investment loss represented less than one percent of the fair value of the U.S. pension and postretirement 
plans’ assets and was reflected in the fair value measurement as of December 31, 2017. 
 
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair 
value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance 
sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement 

94 

benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations 
and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that 
follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet 
and aggregated less than $40 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The balance of amounts recognized for international plans in accumulated other comprehensive income as of 
December 31 in the preceding table are presented based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date. 
 
The pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service 
and compensation as of the measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The 
accumulated benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was $16.270 billion and $15.149 billion at December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation of the international pension plans was $6.870 billion and 
$6.058 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-
based plan. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for 
employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 
2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation. 
 
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for 
the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement 
assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at 
the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt 
instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this 
methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 3.68% for pension and 3.79% for postretirement benefits to be 
appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2017, which is a decrease of 0.53 percentage points and 0.47 
percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2016. For the international pension and 
postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively 
settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected 
cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve 
generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government 
bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields.  
 
Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using 
the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-
specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying 
duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect 
the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains 
and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise 
measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the 
discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning 
in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the change to the spot yield curve approach, 2016 annual defined benefit 
pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost decreased approximately $180 million.  
 
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 
7.25% in 2017. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and 
forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s 
2018 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.25%, consistent with 2017. The expected return 

98 

assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and 
expected performance from active investment management. The 2017 expected long-term rate of return is based on an 
asset allocation assumption of 25% global equities, 16% private equities, 41% fixed-income securities, and 18% absolute 
return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active 
investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2017 was 12.4%. In 2016 the plan earned a rate of 
return of 5.8% and in 2015 earned a return of 0.7%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 
and 25 years has been 7.0% and 9.4%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other 
post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term 
rate of return assumptions.  
 
As of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality 
improvement scale it used for calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement 
obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of this change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension projected benefit 
obligation (PBO) by approximately $820 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 
approximately $100 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company updated the mortality improvement scale to Scale 
MP-2016, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2016. The impact of this change decreased the 
year-end 2016 U.S. pension PBO by approximately $440 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation by approximately $60 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company updated the mortality improvement 
scale to Scale MP-2017. The update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligations. 
 
During 2017, the Company contributed $964 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its 
postretirement plans. During 2016, the Company contributed $380 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and 
$3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2018, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $300 
million to $500 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a required 
minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018. Future contributions will depend on market 
conditions, interest rates and other factors.

Plan Asset Management 
 
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The 
primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of 
return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of 
contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within 
actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional 
contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a 
significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. 
 
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other 
postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly 
buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the 
aggregate fund percentages. 
 
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See 
Note 14 for descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value 
of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets 
 
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the 
investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the 
target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific 
asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed 
to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The 
portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The 
allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately 46% of the postretirement benefit 
plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and 
invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.  
 
The fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:

Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are 
traded. 
 
Fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. 
Corporate debt includes bonds and notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private 
placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market 
derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price reported in the 
active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and 
collateralized mortgage obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers 
with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as 
current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit 
and liquidity risks. Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources.  
 
The private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. 
Derivative investments are written options that are valued by independent parties using market inputs and valuation 
models. Growth equity investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual 
securities are traded.

Absolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund 
vehicles. Corporate debt instruments are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of 
issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such 
as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as 
credit and liquidity risk ratings. 
  
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include, interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts 
payable for securities purchased and interest payable.

International Pension Plans Assets 
 
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below 
of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 70 defined benefit plans in 26 countries; however, there is 
significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local 
financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The Company 
provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger 
plans. 
 
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when 
necessary.

Fair value of plan assets 
 
*In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its 
equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair 
value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding 
and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are 
intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets. 
 
Equities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly 
traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. 
  
Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and 
other debt) securities. Governments, corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing 
price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with 
similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current 
yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and 
liquidity risks. 
  
Private equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and 
REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is 
traded. 
  
Absolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, 
hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using 

104 

cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative 
instruments consist of interest rate swaps that are used to help manage risks.  
  
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities 
sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.  
 
The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of 
insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. The aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains 
increased this balance by $48 million and $8 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign currency exchange impacts 
increased this balance by $16 million in 2017 and decreased this balance by $9 million in 2016.  
 
NOTE 13.  Derivatives 
 
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to 
manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The 
information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 
3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s financial 
position and performance. 
 
Additional information with respect to the impacts on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and 
derivative instruments is included in Note 7. Additional information with respect to the fair value of derivative 
instruments is included in Note 14. References to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments 
associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also made in Note 11. 
 
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income: 
 
Cash Flow Hedges: 
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on 
the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same 
period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge 
ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in 
foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these 
derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period 
during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in 
advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument 
previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other 
comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the 
value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not 
Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to 
the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. 
 
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts: In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company entered into 
forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 500 million Euros as a hedge against interest rate 
volatility associated with the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. 3M terminated these interest rate swaps upon 
issuance of 750 million Euros aggregate principal amount of twelve-year fixed rate notes in connection with 3M’s 1.250 
billion Eurobond offering in November 2014. The termination resulted in an $8 million pre-tax ($5 million after-tax) loss 
within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the twelve-year life of the notes. 

In the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 
2016 with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a 
forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Upon issuance of medium-term notes in September 2016, 3M terminated these 

 

105 

interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that 
will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward 
starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated 
with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. 
 
In the first, second, and third quarters of 2017, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swaps 
with notional amounts of $200 million in each quarter as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with a 
forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Prior to the issuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these 
interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that 
will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt. 
 
The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the  
gain/(loss) recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated 
other comprehensive income. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a balance of $112 million associated with the after tax net unrealized loss 
associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a 
remaining balance of $8 million (after tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized 
over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, 3M expects to reclassify 
approximately $64 million, $30 million, and approximately $18 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange 
cash flow hedging losses to earnings in 2018, 2019, and after 2019, respectively (with the impact offset by 
earnings/losses from underlying hedged items). 
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses 
related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of 
amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated 
hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the forecasted transaction.

Fair Value Hedges: 
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well 
as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps: The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating 
rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, 
the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts 

106 

calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is 
recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which 
also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings 
due to hedge ineffectiveness. 
 
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M 
completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a 
portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation. 
 
In June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the 
Company entered into an interest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an 
interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate 
medium-term note obligation. 
 
In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the 
Company entered into two interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term 
note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note, and the second converted $300 million of a 
five-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index. 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that 
converted the company’s fixed-rate medium-term note due 2020 into a floating-rate note as a hedge of its exposure to 
changes in the fair value that is attributable to interest rate risk. 
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments 
designated as fair value hedges and similar information relative to the hedged items are as follows:

Net Investment Hedges: 
 
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward 
contracts) instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign 
exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that 
meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in 
cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is 
recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to 
circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign 
operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment 
hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes 
are recorded in earnings through their maturity date. 
 

107 

3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries can vary by time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such 
relationships are dedesignated, matured, or are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in 
connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange risk coverage. 
 
At December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment 
hedges was approximately 150 million Euros and approximately 248 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal 
amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 4.4 billion Euros. The maturity dates 
of these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2018 to 2031. 
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses 
related to derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. There were no 
reclassifications of the effective portion of net investment hedges out of accumulated other comprehensive income into 
income for the periods presented in the table below.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: 
 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts 
that formerly were designated in cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). 
In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany 
activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements) and enters into commodity price swaps to 
offset, in part, fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These derivative 
instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are 
recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments: 
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair 
value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals 
and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into 
master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master 
netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty 
as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2017, 3M has International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 17 applicable banks and financial institutions which contain netting 
provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also 
has associated credit support agreements in place with 16 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other 
things, provide the circumstances under which either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value 
of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been 
downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these 
counterparties. 
 
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance 
sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise 
qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset 
the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default 
or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, 
if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period 
based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not 
eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash collateral had been received or pledged 
related to these derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Effects 
 
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax 
income by approximately $152 million in 2017 and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $69 million in 2016. 
These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign 
currency exchange rate risks. 

 
 

 

NOTE 14.  Fair Value Measurements 
 
3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured 
at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the 
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value 
that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most 
observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the 
asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable 
inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the 
asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down 
into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 
inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets 
or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization 
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: 
 
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale 
marketable securities and certain derivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and 
net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to 
these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to 
nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a 
recurring basis for 2017 and 2016. 
 

112 

3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect 
to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities: 
 
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average 
price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data 
providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are 
used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. 
treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are 
classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 10. 
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only: 
 
3M holds municipal bonds with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal securities 
holding as of December 31, 2017. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the 
financial health of the City of Nevada, any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic 
considerations related to the direction of interest rates and the health of the overall municipal bond market, and as such 
will be classified as a level 3 security. 
 
Derivative instruments: 
 
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to 
be recorded at fair value. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and 
option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is 
recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment 
are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is 
marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors 
that may impact fair value. 
 
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, 
interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted 
prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest 
rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily 
observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary source for forward and spot rate 
information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party 
or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis (at least annually). Refer to Note 12. 
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis: 
 
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair 
value relate primarily to long-lived asset impairments. During 2017, the Company recognized approximately $61 million 
in long-lived asset impairments within its Electronics and Energy and Industrial business segments, with the complete 
carrying amount of such assets written off and included in operating income results. There were no material long-lived 
asset impairments for 2016 and 2015. 
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
 
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, 
certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated 
carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in 
addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To 
estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are 
derived all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information 
with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

Long-term debt, excluding current portion 
 
The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. 
The carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that 
are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as 
hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its European subsidiaries. Many of 3M’s fixed-rate bonds were 
trading at a premium at December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the low interest rates and tightening of 3M’s credit spreads.

NOTE 15.  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Capital and Operating Leases: 
 
Rental expense under operating leases was $343 million in 2017, $318 million in 2016 and $316 million in 2015. It is 
3M’s practice to secure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a 
presence in a leased facility. 3M has two primary capital leases. The first, which became effective in April 2003, 
involves a building in the United Kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years). During the second quarter of 2003, 3M 
recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5 million British Pound (GBP), or approximately $27 
million at December 31, 2017, exchange rates. For the second, 3M sold and leased-back certain recently constructed 
machinery and equipment in return for municipal bonds with the City of Nevada, Missouri. 3M recorded a capital lease 
asset and obligation of approximately $13 million in 2017, $12 million in 2016, and $15 million in earlier years, with a 
lease term of 15 years.  
 
Minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of 
December 31, 2017, were as follows:

Unconditional Purchase Obligations: 
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and 
legally binding (non-cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total 
unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 
2017, at $800 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows: 2018 ($271 million), 2019 ($211 million), 2020 ($150 
million), 2021 ($99 million), 2022 ($56 million) and after 2022 ($13 million). Many of these commitments relate to take 
or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to 
customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase 
obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent 
only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are 
purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication 
of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to purchases. 
 
Warranties/Guarantees: 
 
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term 
liabilities, are estimated at approximately $50 million at December 31, 2017, and $47 million at December 31, 2016. 3M 
does not consider this amount to be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other 
guarantee arrangements are not material. 
 
Related Party Activity: 
 
3M does not have any material related party activity.

Legal Proceedings: 

 

The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United 
States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the 
Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including 
those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is 
vigorously defending all such litigation. 
 
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings 
 
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are 
actual damages and are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a 
series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company 
complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal 
proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable. 
Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, 
or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss 
or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The 
Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not 
estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. 
 
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, 
pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of 
the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured 
matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that 
it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not 
taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the 
Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that 
it expects to recover for the expense incurred. 
 
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be 
no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future 
adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. Although the 
Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently believes, except as described below, that such 
future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the 
Company. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and 
associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be 
not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated 
liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company could change in 
the future. 
 
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then 
describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal 
proceedings. 
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in 
various courts that purport to represent approximately 2,230 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,660 
individual claimants with actions pending at December 31, 2016. 
 

117 

The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some 
of the Company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged 
personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in 
products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved 
by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos 
from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured 
by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises. 
 
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of 
filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at 
much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including 
mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. The Company 
has prevailed in all twelve cases taken to trial, including ten of the eleven cases tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 
1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2015, and the cases tried in 2016 and 2017–described below), and an appellate 
reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict adverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by 
the court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the court’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented 
sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict. In August 2016, 3M received a unanimous verdict in its favor from a jury in 
state court in Kentucky, in 3M’s first respirator trial involving coal mine dust. The estate of the plaintiff alleged that the 
3M 8710 respirator is defective and caused his death because it did not protect him from harmful coal mine dust. The 
jury rejected plaintiff’s claim and returned a verdict finding no liability against 3M. The verdict is final as the plaintiff 
did not file an appeal. In September 2017, 3M received a unanimous verdict in its favor from a jury in state court in 
Kentucky in 3M’s second respirator trial involving coal mine dust. The jury ultimately determined that the plaintiff’s 
claims were barred by the statute of limitations. In November 2017, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a new 
trial. The plaintiff did not file an appeal, thereby ending the litigation. 
 
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as 
claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently the Company believes that 
claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s 
respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons with 
malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average 
cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior 
periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. 
 
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the 
Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West 
Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory 
damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s compensation and 
healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The 
case was inactive from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in 
March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages 
proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for 
this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the 
Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by 
the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims 
against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability 
and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried. 
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables 
 
The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company 
reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the 
Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask 
or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims 
pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and 

118 

resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims 
Data”). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with 
expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company 
in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses these estimates to develop its 
best estimate of probable liability.  
 
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are 
not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including, the number 
of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims, and in 
maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and 
(iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers. 
 
As a result of the Company’s review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and as a result of the cost of resolving 
claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, the Company 
increased its accruals in 2017 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $71 million. In 2017, the Company made 
payments for legal fees and settlements of $58 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo 
accruals) of $608 million and $595 million, respectively. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of 
probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the 
year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may 
exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims 
that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly 
always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual 
defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by 
state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the 
several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos 
litigation was $4 million. The Company is seeking coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. 
Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance 
coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims. 
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies 
 
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo 
Technologies (“Aearo”). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such 
as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business 
(American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named 
defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which 
plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged 
personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other occupational dusts found in products 
manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. 
 
As a result of the review of Aearo’s respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased Aearo’s accruals in 2017 
for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $13 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company, through its Aearo 
subsidiary, had accruals of $30 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-
related asbestos and silica-related claims. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s probable loss 
and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Aearo approaching the year 2050. 
Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement 
among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers 
(the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold 
respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical 

119 

Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is 
further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, 
so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and 
indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for 
respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains 
in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the 
alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these 
arrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators 
involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay 
the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period 
covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no 
longer able to meet its obligations in these matters. 
 
In March 2012, Cabot CSC Corporation and Cabot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Aearo in the Superior Court of 
Suffolk County, Massachusetts seeking declaratory relief as to the scope of Cabot’s indemnity obligations under the 
July 11, 1995 agreement, including whether Cabot has retained liability for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis claims, and 
seeking damages for breach of contract. In 2014, the court granted Aearo’s motion for summary judgment on two claims, 
but declined to rule on two issues: the specific liability for certain known coal mine dust lawsuits; and Cabot’s claim for 
allocation of liability between injuries allegedly caused by exposure to coal mine dust and injuries allegedly caused by 
exposure to silica dust. Following additional discovery, the parties filed new motions for summary judgment. In 
February 2016, the court ruled in favor of Aearo on these two remaining issues, and ordered that Cabot, and not Aearo, is 
solely responsible for all liability for the coal mine dust lawsuits under the 1995 agreement. In May 2017, the 
Massachusetts Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court order in favor of Aearo. 
 
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not 
limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving 
claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and 
nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable 
to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability 
of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination 
that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The 
Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo’s share of 
liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual 
amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. 
 
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of 
allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur 
that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by 
which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established. 
 
Environmental Matters and Litigation 
 
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, 
wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by 
national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and 
regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or 
compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has 
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, 
defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its 
environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental 
laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental 
standards of performance for its operations worldwide. 
 

120 

Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other 
companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site 
locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have 
some liability. Please refer to the section entitled “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” that follows for 
information on the amount of the accrual. 
 
Environmental Matters 
 
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal 
(primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and 
health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanyl compounds such as perfluorooctanoate 
(“PFOA”), perfluorooctane sulfonate (“PFOS”), or similar compounds (“PFCs”). As a result of its phase-out decision in 
May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds. The company ceased manufacturing and 
using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement, and ceased 
all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its ongoing life cycle 
management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering 
the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to control or eliminate the presence of 
certain PFCs in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M’s fluorochemical manufacturing processes, 
products, and waste streams. 
 
Regulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before 
certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and 
consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both PFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has 
developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In February 2014, the 
EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review 
panel met in August 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 
parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 
ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA recommends that the concentrations be added together, 
and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 70 ppt. Lifetime health advisories, while not 
enforceable, serve as guidance and are benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in tap water from 
public utilities are safe for public consumption. In an effort to collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act, the EPA published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFCs, required to be 
monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. 
Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime 
health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from 
the July 2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking 
water samples stated that 65 public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results 
are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions 
of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public water 
supplies. 
 
The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic 
disposal of PFC-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, 
Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action 
agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the 
soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for 
approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFCs in fields 
at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFCs in the soil, ADEM agreed 
that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the 
manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues 
and is expected to be completed in 2018. 
 

121 

The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the 
previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFCs in the 
soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the 
Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal 
obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFCs from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing 
treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health 
Risk Limit (“HRL”) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health 
(MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFCs for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a 
result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFCs at these sites that are not 
controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain 
perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former 
disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal 
decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and 
summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 
3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were 
recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and 
Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site 
during 2018. 
 
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its 
manufacturing facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater 
monitoring and routine reporting of results. 
 
In May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOS and PFOA. The new HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA and 27 ppt for 
PFOS. In connection with its announcement, the MDH stated that “Drinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the 
levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate health risk. These values are designed to reduce long-
term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, 
which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV 
for perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 2 ppb. 
 
The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if 
any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions. 
 
Alabama Environmental Litigation 
 
As previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan 
County, Alabama (the “St. John case”), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased 
risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s 
Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The court in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the named 
plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the 
state’s Workers Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in November 2006, limiting the 
case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the 
Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional defendants, including BFI 
Waste Management Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur, 
Alabama; Morgan County, Alabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur 
Utilities.  
 
In 2005, the judge -- in a second purported class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, 
seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of 
certain perfluorochemical compounds from the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly 
manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler case”) -- granted the Company’s motion to abate the case, effectively 
putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St. John case. Despite the stay, 
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on behalf of 

122 

the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. No further action in the case is expected unless and until the 
stay is lifted. 
 
In February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of 
Franklin County (the “Stover case”) seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the 
Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that 
allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other perfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all 
persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS, and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on 
their property. In March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the case transferred from Franklin County to 
Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County Circuit Court abated 
this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case. 
 
In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual 
complaint against 3M Company, Dyneon, L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Alabama. The complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of 
themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the Water Authority and five 
local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the “Water Utilities”). The complaint seeks 
compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’ chemicals, including 
PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at 
the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the Water 
Authority. In September 2016, the court granted 3M’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ trespass claims with prejudice, 
negligence claims for personal injuries, and private nuisance claims, and denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ 
negligence claims for property damage, public nuisance, abatement of nuisance, battery and wantonness.  
 
In June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of Alabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; 
and the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants 
violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFCs through their 
ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent 
and substantial endangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to 
suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested 
relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.  
 
In August 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer 
Authority (Water Authority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, 
Alabama. Plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence, Morgan and other counties who are or have been customers of the Water 
Authority. They contend defendants have released PFCs that contaminate the Tennessee River and, in turn, their drinking 
water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John case, discussed above, 
stayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case. 
 
In September 2016, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Gadsden, Alabama filed a lawsuit in the Circuit 
Court of Etowah County Alabama against 3M and various carpet manufacturers. The complaint alleges that PFCs from 
the defendants’ facilities contaminated the Coosa River as its raw water source for drinking water and seeks unstated 
damages for the installation and operation of a filtration system, expenses to monitor PFC levels, and lost profits and 
sales. 
 
In January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and 
Morgan Counties, Alabama. The plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who 
receive their water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert 
common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive relief and 
punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in 
Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface 
water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have 
discharged into Bakers Creek and the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in turn, 

123 

discharges wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result the 
alleged discharges, the water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, 
PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. 
 
In May 2017, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the Town of Centre, Alabama filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of 
Cherokee County Alabama against 3M, DuPont, and various carpet and textile manufacturers. The complaint alleges that 
PFCs from the defendants’ facilities contaminated the town’s raw water source for drinking water and seeks unstated 
damages for the installation and operation of a filtration system, expenses to monitor PFC levels, lost profits and sales, 
and injunctive relief. 
 
In November 2017, a purported class action was filed against 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, Daikin America, and the West 
Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of Alabama. The plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence and Morgan County, Alabama who receive their water from the 
Water Authority. They assert various common law claims, including negligence, nuisance, wantonness, and fraudulent 
concealment, and they seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged 
personal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in 
Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface 
water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have 
discharged into the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in turn, discharges wastewater 
containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result the alleged discharges, the 
water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related 
chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. 
 
Minnesota Environmental Litigation 
 
In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General Lori Swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the 
natural resources of the State of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover 
damages (including unspecified assessment costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and 
loss of use of certain of the State’s natural resources under the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act 
(MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as statutory nuisance and common law 
claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFCs in the groundwater, surface water, fish 
or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also seeks declarations under MERLA that 3M is 
responsible for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFCs into 
the environment, and under MWPCA that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, 
aquatic life, and other damages. In September 2017, the State’s damages expert submitted a report that contends the State 
incurred $5 billion in damages. In November 2017, the State of Minnesota filed a motion for leave to amend its 
complaint to seek punitive damages from 3M, and 3M filed a motion for summary judgment contending, among other 
things, that the State’s claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. A hearing on those motions was held in 
December 2017. In December 2017, the court urged the parties to attempt to resolve the litigation before trial, and in 
January 2018, the court appointed a mediator to facilitate that process. If the parties are not able to resolve the matter, the 
trial is scheduled to begin in February 2018. An adverse ruling or judgment, settlement, or unfavorable development in 
the NRD Lawsuit could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of 
operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded and on the consolidated financial position of the 
Company. No liability has been recorded because the Company believes any such liability is not probable and estimable. 
 
In November 2011, the Metropolitan Council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the NRD Lawsuit seeking 
compensatory damages and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for costs 
and fees that the Metropolitan Council alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the MPCA 
imposes restrictions on Metropolitan Council’s PFOS discharges to the Mississippi River, including the installation and 
maintenance of a water treatment system. The Metropolitan Council’s intervention motion was based on several theories, 
including common law negligence, and statutory claims under MERLA for response costs, and under the Minnesota 
Environmental Rights Act (MERA) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3M for PFOS and other PFC pollution of 
the waters and sediments of the Mississippi River. 3M did not object to the motion to intervene. In January 2012, 3M 
answered the Metropolitan Council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the Metropolitan Council 

124 

discharges PFCs to the Mississippi River and discharges PFC-containing sludge and bio solids from one or more of its 
wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and local area landfills. Accordingly, 3M’s complaint against the 
Metropolitan Council asked that if the court finds that the State is entitled to any of the damages it sought, 3M be 
awarded contribution and apportionment from the Metropolitan Council, including attorneys’ fees, under MERLA, and 
contribution from and liability for the Metropolitan Council’s proportional share of damages awarded to the State under 
the MWPCA, as well as under statutory nuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance, and negligence. 3M 
also sought declaratory relief under MERA. In May 2017, the Metropolitan Council paid 3M approximately $1 million 
and agreed to dismiss its claims against 3M. As part of the settlement agreement, 3M agreed to dismiss its claims against 
the Metropolitan Council.  
 
In April 2012, 3M filed a motion to disqualify the State of Minnesota’s counsel, Covington & Burling, LLP (Covington). 
In October 2012, the court granted 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington as counsel to the State, and the State and 
Covington appealed the court’s disqualification to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2013, the Minnesota Court of 
Appeals affirmed the district court’s disqualification order. In October 2013, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted both 
the State’s and Covington’s petition for review of the decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In April 2014, the 
Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. The district court took evidence on the disqualification issues at a hearing in October 2015. In February 
2016, the district court ruled that Covington violated the professional ethics rule against representing a client (here the 
State of Minnesota) in the same or substantially related matter where that person’s interests are materially adverse to the 
interests of a former client (3M). The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it 
further found that 3M impliedly waived by delaying to assert the conflict. Other activity in the case, which had been 
stayed pending the outcome of the disqualification issue, has resumed. Trial of the NRD Lawsuit is scheduled to begin in 
February 2018. In a separate but related action, the Company filed suit in the Ramsey County District Court against 
Covington for breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company and for breach of contract arising out of Covington’s 
representation of the State of Minnesota in the NRD Lawsuit. In September 2016, the court granted 3M’s motion for 
leave to amend the complaint to plead punitive damages. In February 2017, Covington settled this lawsuit with a 
payment by Covington or its insurer to 3M that is not material to 3M’s results of operations or financial condition. 
 
In July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M 
alleging that the City suffered damages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFCs, including costs to 
construct alternative sources of drinking water. Trial is scheduled to begin in September 2019. 
 
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Litigation 
 
3M manufactured and marketed Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for use in firefighting at airports and military 
bases from approximately 1963 to 2000. As of December 31, 2017, twelve purported class actions have been filed 
against 3M and other defendants in various state and federal courts in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New York alleging 
that certain PFCs used in AFFF contaminated the soil and groundwater where AFFF was used at current or former 
airports and air force military bases located in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and New York. An individual complaint also has 
been filed in federal court Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that contaminated groundwater has 
caused various injuries, including loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation 
costs, and remediation costs. Some cases seek funds for medical monitoring. Several companies have been sued along 
with 3M, including Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, National 
Foam, Inc., United Technologies Corp. 
 
In November 2016, the Town of Barnstable, MA filed an individual action in the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Massachusetts seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages and other relief against 3M and other suppliers of 
AFFF for alleged contamination of the aquifer supplying drinking water to the Hyannis water system. The town seeks to 
recover costs associated with the investigation, treatment, remediation, and monitoring of drinking water supplies 
allegedly contaminated with certain PFCs used in AFFF. In January 2017, the County of Barnstable, MA, filed an 
individual action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking unstated compensatory and punitive 
damages and other relief (including indemnification and contribution in connection with claims asserted against the 
County by the Town of Barnstable) against 3M and other suppliers of AFFF for alleged contamination of the aquifer 
supplying drinking water to the Hyannis water system.  

125 

 
In February 2017, husband and wife plaintiffs sued 3M and other defendants in federal court in Pennsylvania, alleging 
personal injury, loss of consortium and companionship, and associated damages. 
 
In March 2017, plaintiff residents of Suffolk County, Long Island filed a class action complaint in state court in Suffolk 
County New York, naming the County and 3M and other alleged manufacturers of AFFF products. The action was 
removed to the Eastern District of New York. 
 
In August 2017, three class action complaints were filed in state court in New York against 3M and other defendants 
including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Plaintiffs allege PFC contamination of the local water supply 
linked to AFFF at Stewart Air National Guard Base and Stewart International Airport. The Port Authority is the 
leaseholder of the airport. All three cases have classes for diminution of property and medical monitoring. In September 
2017, co-defendant Tyco removed all three cases to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
 
In October 2017, a class action complaint was filed in Suffolk County, New York against 3M and others regarding PFCs 
allegedly released at the Suffolk County Firematics Training Facility. In November 2017, co-defendant National Foam 
removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 
 
In December 2017, a complaint was filed by a group of 26 plaintiffs in Suffolk County, New York against 3M and others 
regarding PFCs allegedly released at Gabreski Airport. 
 
In December 2017, a complaint was filed by the Suffolk County Water District in December 2017 in the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of New York against 3M and others regarding PFCs allegedly released at Gabreski Airport 
and Suffolk County Firematics Training Facility. 
 
Other Environmental Litigation 
 
In September 2017, three complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against 
3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (“Saint-Gobain”), Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) and E.I. 
DuPont De Nemours and Company. Plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for 
manufacturing purposes at Saint-Gobain’s and Honeywell’s facilities located in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the 
Town of Hoosick. Plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around Hoosick Falls became contaminated with unsafe levels 
of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants, and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to the ingestion and 
inhalation of PFOA. Plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ 
fees and costs. 
 
On December 1, 2017, eight plaintiffs filed a 12-count class action against 3M, Wolverine World Wide and Waste 
Management, Inc., alleging negligence, trespass, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, battery, 
products liability, public and private nuisance, fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment. Each count was filed 
against each defendant. The action arises from Wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes related 
to their shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and 
that chemicals from 3M’s product have contaminated the environment after being disposed of near drinking water 
sources. 
 
For environmental litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the 
Company believes the amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accrual 
is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. For those matters for which a 
liability has not been recorded, the Company believes any such liability is not probable and estimable and the Company 
is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time. 
 
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had recorded liabilities of $28 million for estimated “environmental 
remediation” costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also 

126 

recorded related insurance receivables of $8 million. The Company records liabilities for remediation costs on an 
undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility 
studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, 
depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the 
number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the 
contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further 
information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the 
periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had recorded liabilities of $25 million for “other environmental liabilities” 
based upon an evaluation of currently available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with 
the MPCA, the remedial action agreement with ADEM, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in 
drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale, Minnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the 
Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal 
sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that most of the spending will 
occur over the next four years. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company collected from its insurer the outstanding 
receivable of $15 million related to “other environmental liabilities.” 
 
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the 
interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental 
contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the 
Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the 
environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in 
permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, 
including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; 
(iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other 
potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation 
liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity 
relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the 
Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely 
ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for 
the reasons described above. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Department of Labor Investigation 
 
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) notified 3M in April 2015 that it had commenced an investigation of 3M’s 
pension plan pursuant to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The DOL 
has stated its investigation relates to certain private equity investments, plan expenses, securities lending, and 
distributions of plan benefits. In response to certain DOL requests, 3M produced documents and made employees 
available for interviews. In December 2016, the DOL issued certain subpoenas to 3M and 3M Investment Management 
Corp. relating to this investigation. 3M has produced additional responsive documents and is cooperating with the DOL 
in its investigation. 3M anticipates that the DOL will conclude its investigation in the first half of 2018. 
 
Product Liability Litigation 
 
One customer obtained an order in the French courts against 3M Purification SAS (a French subsidiary) in October 2011 
appointing an expert to determine the amount of commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by allegedly 
defective 3M filters used in the customer’s manufacturing process. An Austrian subsidiary of this same customer also 
filed a claim against 3M Austria GmbH (an Austrian subsidiary) and 3M Purification SAS in the Austrian courts 
in September 2012 seeking damages for the same issue. The Company reached an agreement in principle to settle those 

127 

two cases and finalized the settlement during the second quarter of 2017. The amounts agreed to in each of these 
settlements were not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 4,270 plaintiffs 
(compared to approximately 1,260 plaintiffs at December 31, 2016), most of which are pending in federal or state court 
in Minnesota, in which the plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries 
and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The complaints 
seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, 
failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust 
enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising 
acts. One case, from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee is a putative nationwide class action. 
The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the plaintiffs’ motion to transfer and consolidate all 
cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district 
proceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation. The federal court has set a trial-ready date in May 2018 in one of 
the two federal court bellwether cases. At a joint hearing before the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota State court, on 
the parties’ motion to exclude each other’s experts, and 3M’s motion for summary judgment with respect to general 
causation, the federal court did not exclude the plaintiffs’ experts and denied 3M’s motion for summary judgment on 
general causation. In January 2018, the state court, in hearing the same arguments, excluded plaintiffs’ experts and 
granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation, dismissing all 61 cases pending before the state court 
in Minnesota. 
 
In June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all 
Canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed 
surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks 
relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL. The Bair 
Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part of the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of 
patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature in surgical settings. 
No liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and 
estimable at this time. 
 
In September 2011, 3M Oral Care launched Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM dental restorative material. The product was 
originally indicated for inlay, onlay, veneer, and crown applications. In June 2015, 3M Oral Care voluntarily removed 
crown applications from the product’s instructions for use, following reports from dentists of patients’ crowns 
debonding, requiring additional treatment. The product remains on the market for other applications. 3M communicated 
with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as regulators outside the United States. 3M also informed 
customers and distributors of its action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds. As of 
December 31, 2017, there is one lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota that names 29 
plaintiffs and seeks certification of a class of dentists in the United States and its territories, and alternatively seeks 
subclasses in 13 states. The complaint alleges 3M marketed and sold defective Lava Ultimate material used for dental 
crowns to dentists and, under various theories, seek monetary damages (replacement costs and business reputation loss), 
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits, injunction from marketing and selling Lava Ultimate for use in dental 
crowns, statutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  
 
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company 
believes the amount recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at 
this time. 
 
NOTE 16.  Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 123,965,000 shares of 3M 
common stock pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, 
nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, 
other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining total shares 

128 

available for grant under the LTIP Program are 30,125,144, and there were approximately 7,500 participants with 
outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units. 
 
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and 
immediate link between the performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock 
compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting 
rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense 
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having 
completed ten years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the 2017 annual stock-based 
compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first 
quarter. 
 
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other 
stock-based grants. The Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain 
countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial for disclosure 
purposes by the Company. 
 
Beginning in 2016, as a result of the Company’s application of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-
Based Payment Accounting, certain excess tax benefits at the time of exercise (for an option) or upon vesting (for 
restricted stock units) are recognized as income tax benefits in the statement of income. These amounts totaled $228 
million and $184 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected in the “income tax benefits” line within the 
stock-based compensation table below. 
 
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock 
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan 
(GESPP), are provided in the following table. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material.

Stock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant. As of 
December 31, 2017, there was $67 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested 
stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting 
period of 20 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2017, the weighted-average remaining contractual life 
was 70 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $3.834 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2017, the 
weighted-average remaining contractual life was 56 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $3.080 billion. 
 
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $703 million, $608 million and 
$465 million, respectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $585 million, $665 
million and $501 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the 
exercise of employee stock options for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $238 million, $224 million and $172 million, 
respectively. 
 
The Company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; 
however, the Company has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends, 
and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity. 
 
For annual options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model and the assumptions that follow.  
 
Stock Option Assumptions 
  
 
 
Exercise price 
Risk-free interest rate 
Dividend yield 
Expected volatility 
Expected life (months) 
Black-Scholes fair value 
 
Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. 
For the 2017 annual grant date, the Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most recent 
one year volatility, the median of the term of the expected life rolling volatility, the median of the most recent term of the 
expected life volatility of 3M stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is based 
on the weighted average of historical grants.

As of December 31, 2017, there was $78 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-
vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-
average vesting period of 22 months. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during 
2017, 2016 and 2015 was $136 million, $149 million and $166 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits 
realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2017, 2016 and 2015 
was $45 million, $56 million and $62 million, respectively. 
 
Restricted stock units granted generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. 
Dividend equivalents equal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these 
restricted stock units during the vesting period, although no dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock 
units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date on restricted stock units, 
except for performance shares which do not earn dividends. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no 
impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in 
the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
 
Performance Shares 
 
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive 
management. The 2017 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested 
capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they 
are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be 
delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share 
granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Non-substantive vesting 
requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each 
individual became a 3M executive. Prior to the 2016 performance share grant, performance shares did not accrue 
dividends during the performance period. Therefore, the grant date fair value was determined by reducing the closing 
stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance period. The 2017 and 2016 
performance share grants accrue dividends, therefore the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the 
date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. 
Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted 
earnings per share.

NOTE 17.  Business Segments 
 
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, 
technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health 
Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. 3M’s five business segments bring together common or related 3M 
technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of 
business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise 
characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management 
does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. 
The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are 
not allocated to business segments.

Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around 
markets and customers the Company made the following changes: 

Integrated the former Renewable Energy Division into existing divisions; 

1. 
2.  Combined two divisions to form the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division; and  
3.  Consolidated U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting  

 
Integration of former Renewable Energy Division 

•  The (i) solar and wind and (ii) energy product lines (along with certain technology previously included in 

Corporate and Unallocated) of the former Renewable Energy Division (RED) were integrated into the existing 
Electrical Markets Division and Electronics Materials Solutions Division, respectively, within the Electronics 
and Energy business segment. In addition, the former RED’s window film product lines were moved into the 
Commercial Solutions Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment. This change resulted in a 
decrease in previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2016 of $203 million and $38 
million, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment. These decreases were offset by a $207 million and 
$29 million increase in previously reported total year 2016 net sales and operating income, respectively, in the 
Safety and Graphics business segment and a $4 million decrease and $9 million increase in previously reported 
net sales and operating income, respectively, in Corporate and Unallocated. 

 
Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division 

•  The former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division (both within the 

Industrial business segment) were combined to create the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division. 
Because this realignment was within the Industrial business segment, it had no impact on business segment 
reporting. 

 
Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting 

•  The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts to 

better serve customers. As discussed further below, 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit 
to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which 
business segment provides customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to a particular product sold 
in the U.S. Previously, a customer in the U.S. may have been aligned to several sales districts associated with 
multiple divisions or segments based on the individual products the customer purchased across 3M’s portfolio. 
The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts therefore changed the attribution 
of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net 
sales and operating income for total year 2016 increased $163 million and $36 million, respectively, offset by 
similar increases in the elimination of dual credit net sales and operating income amounts. 

 
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for 
all periods presented.

Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment 
gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and 
environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-
based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this 
category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. 
 
3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related 
operating income. Management evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income 
performance, including dual credit U.S. reporting to further incentivize U.S. sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects 
additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect

to the particular product sold to the external customer in the U.S. is provided by a different business segment. This 
additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the 
Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, a sales district within the Industrial 
business segment provides the contact for sales of the product to particular customers in the U.S. market. In this 
example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated 
through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual 
credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The 
offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual 
Credit,” such that sales and operating income for the U.S. in total are unchanged. 
 
Certain sales and operating income results for electronic bonding product lines are equally divided between the 
Electronics and Energy business segment and the Industrial business segment.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 
 
None. 
 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including 
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the 
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control 
over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the 
assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting is effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2017 excluded Scott Safety, which was acquired by the Company in October 2017 in a 
purchase business combination. Scott Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales 
represented less than 1 percent of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2017. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over 
financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines 
established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting 
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. 
 
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s 
most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected 
to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected 
to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the 
processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness. 
 
The Company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited 
subsidiaries/locations and will continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new 
information technology application we implement, this application, along with the internal controls over financial 
reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the 
implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the 
implementation of ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
Item 9B. Other Information. 
 
None.
