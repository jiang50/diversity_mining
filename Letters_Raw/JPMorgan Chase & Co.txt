Dear Fellow Shareholders,

Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer

Once again, I begin this letter with a sense of pride about JPMorgan Chase. As I 
look back on last year — in fact, the last decade — it is remarkable how well our 
company has performed. And I’m not only talking about our strong financial 
performance — but also about how much we have accomplished to help our clients, 
customers and communities all around the world. Ours is an exceptional company 
with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. 

We continue to make excellent progress around technology, risk and controls, 
innovation, diversity and reduced bureaucracy. We’ve helped communities large 
and small — by doing what we do best (lending, investing and serving our clients); 
by creatively expanding certain flagship Corporate Responsibility programs, 
including the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, The Fellowship Initiative and our Service 
Corps; and by applying our successful Detroit investment model to neighborhood 
revitalization efforts in the Bronx in New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C. 

Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, 
our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and 
countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders.

2017 was another record year across many measures for our company as we added 
clients and customers and delivered record earnings per share. We earned $24.4 
billion in net income on revenue1 of $103.6 billion (if we exclude the tax charge 
at year-end, 2017 net income would have been a record $26.9 billion), reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We now have delivered 
record results in seven of the last eight years, and we have confidence that we will 
continue to deliver in the future.

As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the 
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this 
capital profitably, we now think that it can earn approximately 17% return on 
tangible equity for the foreseeable future. Then, in our view, our company should 
ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. The chart on the 
bottom of page 3 shows that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.

In the last five years, we have bought back nearly $40 billion in stock. In prior 
years, I explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was 
a no-brainer. Six years ago, we offered an example of this, with earnings per share 
and tangible book value per share being substantially higher than they otherwise 
would have been just four years later. While we prefer buying back our stock at 
tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times 
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we 
buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analyst earnings 
estimates for the next five years) earnings per share in five years to be 2% —3% 
higher and tangible book value to be virtually unchanged.

4

We want to remind our shareholders that we much prefer to use our capital to grow 
than to buy back stock. Buying back stock should only be considered when we either 
cannot invest (sometimes that’s a function of regulatory policies) or when we are 
generating excess, unusable capital. We currently have excess capital, but due to 
recent tax reform and a more constructive regulatory environment, we hope, in the 
future, to use more of our excess capital to grow our businesses, expand into new 
markets and support our employees.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.

Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This 
progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good 
times and not-so-good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and 
products. These investments drive the future prospects of our company and 
position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five 
years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 13 
years ago), our stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index (S&P 500) and the S&P Financials Index. And this growth came during a 
time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the 

5

extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environment that followed. 
We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/
earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated 
reversal of many negatives and an increasingly more favorable business 
environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the 
reasons our stock price has done so well this past year. 

We do not worry about the stock price in the short run, and we do not worry about 
quarterly earnings. Our mindset is that we consistently build the company — if  
you do the right things, the stock price will take care of itself. In the next section,  
I discuss in more detail how we think about building shareholder value for the long 
run while also taking care of customers, employees and communities.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate owner is an individual. Well over 100 million 
people in the United States own stocks, and a large percentage of them, in one 
way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, 
teachers, police officers, firefighters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school 
or retirement. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the 
enormous responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders. 

In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of our 
successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses.

I.   JPMorgan Chase Business Strategies

1.  How has the company grown?
2.  How will the company continue to grow? What are the organic growth 

opportunities?

3.  Why is organic growth a better way to grow — and why is it sometimes difficult?
4. 

Is there a conflict between building shareholder value vs. serving customers, 
taking care of employees and lifting up communities? 

5.  Transparency, financial discipline and a fortress balance sheet. Why is this 

discipline so important? 

6.  What risks worry us the most? And what could go wrong? 
7.  How is the company dealing with bureaucracy and complacency that often 

infect large companies?   

8.  What are the firm’s views on succession?
 

II.   Public Policy

1.  What has gone wrong in public policy?
2.  Poor public policy — how has this happened?
3.  We can fix this problem through intelligent, thoughtful, analytical and 

comprehensive policy. 

4.  The need for solutions through collaborative, competent government. 
5.  A competitive business tax system is a key pillar of a growth strategy. 
6.  We should reform and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and invest  

in the workforce of the future.

7.  America’s growing fiscal deficit and fixing our entitlement programs.
8.  Why is smart regulation vs. just more regulation so important?
9.  Public company corporate governance — how would you change it? And  

the case against earnings guidance.

10.  Global engagement, trade and immigration — America’s role in the world  

is critical.

JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES

Since our business leaders describe their businesses later in this report, I am not going to be 
repetitive within this section. I encourage you to read their letters following this Letter to 
Shareholders. Instead, in this section, I deal with some critical themes around how we run 
this company – in good times and in bad times – and how we are continuing to build for 
what we think will be a bright future. 

1.  How has the company grown? 

Below is a powerful representation of how 
we have grown and built client franchises 
over time.

You can see from the numbers circled within 
the chart below that we have grown our 
market share fairly substantially in most of 
our businesses. In some cases, these market

share increases were due to our acquisitions 
of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. But 
in all cases, this growth is driven by consis-
tent and disciplined investment in our busi-
nesses. The chart below shows how we try 
to measure customer satisfaction in multiple 

ways. For the most part, we have seen a rise 
in these scores as well. It is a given that you 
will not grow your share – unless you are 
satisfying your customers – and we know 
they can always walk across the street to be 
served by another bank.

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES2.  How will the company continue to grow? What are the organic growth opportunities?

We have good market share in most busi-
nesses, but we see organic growth opportu-
nities almost everywhere – some large and 
some small. Following are a few examples: 

Consumer & Community Banking
•  We recently announced that we will start 
to expand the consumer branch business 
into cities like Boston, Philadelphia and 
Washington, D.C. Over the next five years, 
we hope to expand to another 15-20 new 
markets. We know the competition is 
tough, but we have much to offer. When 
JPMorgan Chase comes to town, we come 
not just with our consumer branches but 
also with mortgages, investments, credit 
cards, private banking, small and midsized 
business banking, government business 
and corporate responsibility initiatives to 
support our communities.

•  In addition, this year we are rolling out 
many new exciting products and have 
made several improvements around the 
customer’s experience, including a fully 
mobile bank pilot (Finn), digital account 
openings, facial recognition in our app, 
the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card and 
a simpler online application for Business 
Banking customers. 

•  We also are adding many tools that will 

help our customers manage their financial 
affairs. For example, in the credit card busi-
ness, we will be allowing our customers 
to review and decide how and where they 
want their cards and credit lines to be used. 
In Consumer Banking, we are adding finan-
cial planning tools and insights that help 
customers make the most of their money – 
and there’s more coming. 

10

Corporate & Investment Bank
•  We see growth opportunities even in 

Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodi-
ties, where we already have the #1 market 
share at 11.4%. There may be some under-
lying growth as the capital markets of the 
world grow, even though this is partially 
offset by declining margins like we 
have experienced over the last 30 years. 
However, we see opportunities to gain 
share in various products and in certain 
regions where we have low share. 

•  This opportunity would be true for Invest-

ment Banking, too. Country by country 
and industry by industry, there are still 
plenty of opportunities to increase our low 
market share. For example, we have 10% 
share in the United States but less than 
5% share in Asia. 

•  In Treasury Services and Custody, where 

our market shares are 4.7% and 8.0%, 
respectively, we believe we can grow 
significantly by adding bankers, building 
better technology, entering new countries, 
building better products and continuing to 
do a great job for clients. In this business, 
while you make large initial investments 
in order to grow, when you gain clients, 
they usually stick with you for a long time. 

•  Over time, we do expect to expand our 
Corporate & Investment Bank into new 
countries, which will benefit all the busi-
nesses within this franchise.

Commercial Banking
•  This past year, Commercial Banking has 
completed its expansion into the top 50 
markets in the United States – this will 
drive growth for decades. And remember, 
when Commercial Banking opens its 
doors, it also helps drive the growth of  
our Private Bank and the Corporate & 
Investment Bank businesses. 

•  Commercial Banking has added many 
specialized industry bankers to better 
serve those specific segments. 

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES •  Across the company – not just in tech-

nology – we have thousands of employees 
who are data scientists or have advanced 
degrees in science, technology, engi-
neering and math. Of the nearly 50,000 
people in technology at the company, 
more than 31,000 are in development and 
engineering jobs, and more than 2,500 
are in digital technology. Think of these 
talented individuals as driving change 
across the company. 

•  Artificial intelligence, big data and machine 

learning are helping us reduce risk and 
fraud, upgrade service, improve under-
writing and enhance marketing across the 
firm. And this is just the beginning.

•  Our shared technology infrastructure 
– our networks, data centers, and the 
public and private cloud – decreases costs, 
enhances efficiency and makes all our 
businesses more productive. In addition, 
this allows us to embrace the fact that 
every business and merchant has its own 
software and also wants easy, integrated 
access to our products and services. We 
are delivering on that through the creation 
of a common JPMorgan Chase API (appli-
cation programming interface) store that 
allows customers to add simple, secure 
payments to their software. And we are 
building everything digital – both for indi-
vidual customers and large corporations – 
from onboarding to idea generation.

•  Increasingly, the management teams  
of Consumer & Community Banking,  
Corporate & Investment Bank,  
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth  
Management share ideas, share platforms 
and serve each other’s customers. The 
success of any one business almost always 
helps the other three.

Asset & Wealth Management
•  In the United States, our share of the 

ultra-high-net-worth market ($10 million 
or greater) is 8%. We believe we have a 
superior business and that we can grow 
our share by essentially adding bankers, 
branches and better products.

•  In the high-net-worth business ($3 million 

to $10 million) and the Chase affluent 
business ($500,000 to $5 million), our 
market shares are only 1% and 4%, respec-
tively. We have no doubt that we can grow 
by adding bankers and locations, particu-
larly because we have some exciting new 
products coming soon. There is no reason 
we can’t more than double our share over 
the next 10 years.

•  We are also adding new products, like 

index funds and exchange-traded funds 
(ETF), that we believe will help drive 
growth.

Across the company
In addition, we are undertaking many 
initiatives across the company that will help 
grow our businesses and better serve our 
customers. 

•  On the payments front, we have devel-

oped multiple products to make wholesale 
payments better, easier and faster. We 
are rolling out these products across our 
platforms, and they should help us solidify 
and grow our position. 

•  On the consumer side, we have intro-

duced Chase Pay, the digital equivalent  
to using a debit or credit card, which 
allows customers to pay online or in-store 
with their mobile phone. We also intro-
duced Zelle, a real-time consumer-to- 
consumer payments system, which 
allows customers to easily, safely and 
immediately send money to their friends 
and family. We expect these products  
to drive lots of customer interactions  
and make our payments offerings 
compelling, even as some very smart 
fintech competitors emerge.

11

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES•  Privacy and safety – we spend an enor-

mous amount of resources to protect 
all of our clients and customers from 
fraud, cybersecurity risk and invasion 
of their privacy. These capabilities are 
extraordinary, and we will continue to 
relentlessly build them. As part of this, we 
have consistently warned our customers 
about privacy issues, which will become 
increasingly critical for all industries 
as consumers realize the severity of 
the problem. Last year, we wrote about 
a new arrangement with Intuit that 
bears repeating – it briefly described 
the problem and presented a solution, 
which we hope might set a standard for 
protecting customers while giving them 
control of their data. 

For years, we have been describing the 
risks – to banks and customers – that arise 
when customers freely give away their 
bank passcodes to third-party services, 
allowing virtually unlimited access to 
their data. Customers often do not know 
the liability this may create for them if 
their passcode is misused, and, in many 
cases, they do not realize how their data 
are being used. For example, access to 

the data may continue for years after 
customers have stopped using the third-
party services. 

We recently completed a new 
arrangement with Intuit, which we think 
represents an important step forward. 
In addition to protecting the bank, the 
customers and even the third party (in 
this case, Intuit), it allows customers to 
share data – how and when they want. 
Under this arrangement, customers can 
choose whatever they would like to share 
and opt to turn these selections on or off 
as they see fit. The data will be “pushed” 
to Intuit, eliminating the need for sharing 
bank passcodes, which protects the bank 
and our customers and reduces potential 
liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. We are 
hoping this sets a new standard for data-
sharing relationships. 

Events from the past year underscore the 
importance of efforts like this. As questions 
are raised about how consumers’ infor-
mation is shared and protected, I strongly 
believe that data privacy and security should 
be a way in which we and other businesses 
compete to serve customers.

3.  Why is organic growth a better way to grow — and why is it sometimes difficult?

efforts require huge team coordination. So 
it’s no surprise that it’s sometimes easier 
not to push organic growth. However, if you 
build the right culture, where management 
teams are intensely analytical and critical of 
their own business’ strengths, weaknesses 
and opportunities, you can create great 
clarity about what those opportunities are. If 
you have strong leaders, they have the disci-
pline and fortitude to develop and execute a 
forward-looking growth plan.

Organic growth is all about hiring and 
training bankers, opening branches, 
improving or innovating new products and 
building new technology. It is hard work. 
In fact, institutionally, there is often a lot 
of resistance to it. It’s easier not to add 
expenses, even when they are good for the 
business. And growing any sales force is 
usually met by some opposition from – guess 
who? – the existing sales force. Sometimes 
people are afraid the change will take away 
from their compensation pool or their client 
base. And it’s hard work to properly recruit 
and train salespeople. Building new products 
and services is sometimes in conflict with 
existing products and services. All of these 

12

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES 4.  Is there a conflict between building shareholder value vs. serving customers, taking care 

of employees and lifting up communities? 

capital. Diligent management teams 
understand the difference between the 
two scenarios and invest in a way that will 
make the company financially successful 
over time. You need to invest continually 
for better products and services so you can 
serve your customers in the future.

A bank cannot simply stop serving its clients 
or halt investing because of quarterly or 
annual earnings pressures. It does not work 
when long-term investing is changed because 
of short-term pressures – you cannot stop-
start training programs and the development 
of new products, among other investments. 
You need to serve your clients and make 
investments while explaining to shareholders 
why certain decisions are appropriate at that 
time. Earnings results for any one quarter or 
even the next few years are fundamentally 
the result of decisions that were made years 
and even decades earlier. 

Keeping JPMorgan Chase a healthy and 
vibrant company is the best thing we can 
do for our shareholders, our customers, our 
employees and our communities. Building 
shareholder value is the primary goal of a 
business, but it is simply not possible to do 
well if a company is not properly treating 
and serving its customers, training and 
motivating its employees, and being a good 
citizen in the community. If they are all 
done well, it enhances shareholder value. 
Let me explain.

We cannot be a healthy and vibrant company if 
we are not both delivering financial success and 
investing for the future.
Show me a company that is not financially 
successful (in the long run), and I will 
show you an unsuccessful company. This is 
particularly true for a bank, where confi-
dence in its stability is critical. I should 
caution, however, that financial success is a 
little more complex than short-term profits 
– and many investors are completely aware 
of this. 

Do not confuse financial success with profits 
in a quarter or even in a year. All businesses 
have a different customer and investment 
life cycle, which can be anywhere from one 
year to 30 years – think of building new 
restaurants to developing new airplanes or 
building electrical grids. Generally, anything 
our business does to grow will cost money 
in the short term (whether it’s opening 
branches or conducting research and devel-
opment (R&D) or launching products), but 
it does not mean that it is not the right 
financial decision. A company could be 
losing money on its way to bankruptcy or 
on its way to a very high return on invested

We have to be there for our clients in good times 
and bad. And we have to continuously improve 
the products and services we provide to them.
If you are a bank, your clients rely on you to 
always be there, regardless of the environ-
ment – banks are the lender of last resort. 
Contrary to public opinion, most banks 
consistently extended credit to their clients 
(without dramatically raising lending rates) 
throughout the Great Recession. The charts 
on page 14 show how we have consistently 
been there for our clients and that they trust 
us to hold their assets.

We simply cannot deliver to our shareholders 
what they deserve if we do not have high-quality, 
motivated, committed employees. 
Talented, diverse employees deliver lifelong 
– and satisfied – customers. They also deliver 
innovative products, excellent training and 
outstanding ideas. Basically, everything we 
do emanates from our employees. And all 
of this creates shareholder value. We do 
not try to get the last dollar of profit off of 
our employees’ or customers’ backs. We 
want long-tenured employees and satisfied 
customers who stay with us year after year. 
We would rather earn a fair return and grow 
our businesses long term than try to maxi-
mize our profit over any one time period.

Great employees are the result of a healthy, 
open and respectful environment and 
continual investment in training. And great 
employees are the result of management 
teams that are humble enough to recog-
nize that they don’t know everything their 
employees do and, therefore, are always 
seeking out constructive feedback.

While keeping JPMorgan Chase a healthy and 
vibrant company is the best thing we can do for 
our communities, there’s a lot more we can do. 
It is important to explain both what we do and 
why it is so important for our communities. 

As the primary engine of economic growth, 
the private sector has an important role to 
play in making sure the benefits are widely 
shared. The future of business and the health 

of our communities are inextricably linked. 
We believe that making the economy work 
for more people is not simply a moral obliga-
tion – it’s a business imperative. 

Using our unique capabilities, we can do 
even more for our communities to help lift 
them up. We have broad and unique knowl-
edge around how communities can develop, 
how work skills can be successfully imple-
mented, how businesses can be started, how 
inequality can be addressed, how financial 
health can be secured, and how more fami-
lies can find jobs and affordable housing. 

We continue to step up our efforts to help 
communities. In 2017, we were honored to 
be ranked by Fortune magazine as the #1 
company changing the world in recognition of 
our work in Detroit and other communities. 

We do extensive investing to help our 
communities, such as providing affordable 
housing, lending to lower income households 
and helping advise governments in economic 
development. Our philanthropic efforts 
are only a part of what we do – but a very 
important part. This year, we announced we 
will increase our philanthropic investments 
by 40%. Over the next five years, we will 
spend $1.75 billion to help drive inclusive 
growth in communities around the world. 
Our head of Corporate Responsibility talks 
about our significant progress and specific 
measures in more detail in his letter, but I 
would like to highlight a few initiatives:

•   We are helping communities realize their 
potential as engines of growth and shared 
prosperity. In 2014, we launched our most 
comprehensive corporate responsibility 
initiative to date to try to help Detroit, 
an iconic city that was long engulfed in 
economic turmoil and then bankruptcy. We 
view our initiative in Detroit as validation 
of our firm’s model for driving inclusive 
growth. Three years in, we exceeded our 
initial $100 million commitment, and we 
now expect to invest $150 million in the 
city by 2019. We see the results on the 
ground – people are moving back into the 
city, small businesses are being created and 

15

Institution shows that, not surprisingly, 
joblessness and incarceration are related. 
Barriers to hiring returning citizens come 
in different forms, and some are imposed 
from the outside. This year, we welcomed 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion’s proposed changes to allow banks 
more flexibility in hiring returning citi-
zens. Our responsibility to recruit, hire, 
retain and train talented workers extends 
to this population. Earlier this year, I 
visited one of our partnering organiza-
tions, the North Lawndale Employment 
Network in Chicago, which gives formerly 
incarcerated Americans a path to well-
paying jobs. The network also builds a 
pipeline of trained mechanics for Chica-
go’s growing transportation sector. This is 
a win-win for workers, employers and the 
economy as a whole. 

•  We are expanding innovative models that 

enable more people to share in the rewards 
of a growing economy. Small businesses are 
growing fastest among people of color, 
yet, despite their critical role in boosting 
economic growth, these businesses 
receive only a fraction of traditional loans 
compared with non-minority entrepre-
neurs. In Detroit, a city with the fourth-
largest number of minority-owned small 
businesses, we quickly saw the need to 
address the challenges facing minority 
entrepreneurs. Therefore, in 2015, we 
helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color 
Fund in Detroit to provide underserved 
entrepreneurs with greater access to the 
capital and assistance they needed. Seeing 
the tremendous success this program has 
had in Detroit, we decided to scale this 
model to the South Bronx in New York 
City, as well as San Francisco – cities that 
are experiencing similar challenges. 

expanded, and for the first time in 17 years, 
property values are on the rise. Our work 
in Detroit has taught us many important 
lessons, and this past year, we extended our 
model for impact to communities in need 
in Chicago and Washington, D.C.

•  Helping people develop the skills they need 
to compete for today’s jobs can transform 
lives and strengthen economies. JPMorgan 
Chase is investing more than $350 million 
to support demand-driven skills training 
around the world. Through New Skills for 
Youth, we launched additional innovation 
sites to expand high-quality, career-focused 
education programs in cities across the 
United States and around the world. 

•  The path to opportunity begins at an early 

age, but too many young people, particularly 
from disadvantaged backgrounds, do not get 
a fair shot at economic opportunity. High 
school graduation rates for young men of 
color are dangerously low, and many who 
do graduate lack the skills they need to 
be successful in college or their careers. 
Through programs like The Fellowship 
Initiative (TFI), we are working to address 
barriers to opportunity. TFI engages 
young men of color in a comprehensive 
program that includes academic support, 
leadership development and mentoring 
during their critical high school years. 
This past year, we expanded this program 
to Dallas and recruited new classes of 
Fellows in Chicago, Los Angeles and 
New York. One hundred percent of these 
students are graduating from high school, 
and, combined, they have been accepted 
into more than 200 colleges and universi-
ties across the country. 

•  Supporting re-entry programs is an important 

part of our effort to create opportunity that 
strengthens communities and results in a 
stronger economy. The overwhelming 
majority of Americans who are incar-
cerated return to their communities 
after they are released. Reducing recidi-
vism is not only important to returning 
citizens and their families – it can also 
have profound implications for public 

16

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES Our Diverse Workforce 

I believe the door to diversity opens when you 
run a great company where everyone feels they 
are treated fairly and with respect – this is what 
we strive to create at JPMorgan Chase. We are 
devoted to diversity for three reasons, and each 
reason stands on its own – combined, they are 
powerful. First, it is the right thing to do from a 
moral perspective. Second, it is better for busi-
ness to include a group of people who represent 
the various communities where we operate. And 
third, if I can pick my team from among all diverse 
people, I will have the best team. 

We have more than 252,000 employees globally, 
with over 170,000 in the United States. Women 
represent 50% of our employees. Recently, Oliver 
Wyman, a leading global management consulting 
firm, issued a report stating that it would be 
30 years before women reach 30% executive 
committee representation within global financial 
services companies. So you might be surprised to 
learn that, today, 50% of the Operating Committee 
members reporting to me are women as are 
approximately 30% of our firm’s senior leader-

Advancing Black Leaders

In 2016, we introduced Advancing Black Leaders 
(ABL), an expanded diversity strategy focused 
on increased hiring, retention and development 
of talent from within the black community. This 
specifically recognized that — with this popula-
tion — we should and could do more. We set up a 
separate group whose sole purpose is to help do 
this better. From training to retention to recruiting 
and hiring new employees, our intensified efforts 
are starting to pay off.

Two years into this initiative, we are seeing 
encouraging results. At executive levels, we closed 
2017 with a noticeable increase in headcount (97 
black managing directors globally, up from 83 a 
year earlier), driven by recruiting new talent and 
promoting existing talent. In addition, we are 
seeing positive headcount gains in our pipeline 

ship globally. They run major businesses – several 
units on their own would be among Fortune 1000 
companies. In addition to having five women on 
our Operating Committee – who run Asset & Wealth 
Management, Finance, Global Technology, Legal 
and Human Resources – some of our other busi-
nesses and functions headed by women include 
Consumer Banking, Credit Card, U.S. Private Bank, 
U.S. Mergers & Acquisitions, Global Equity Capital 
Markets, Global Research, Global Custody, Regula-
tory Affairs, Global Philanthropy, our U.S. branch 
network, our Controller and firmwide Marketing.  
I believe we have some of the best women leaders 
in the corporate world globally. In addition to 
gender diversity, 48% of our firm’s population is 
ethnically diverse in the United States. 

We are proud of JPMorgan Chase’s industry recog-
nition for its diversity and inclusion efforts. In 2017, 
we received more than 50 awards that recog-
nize the firm and represent the diversity of our 
employees. 

for mid-level managers over the last two years, 
with executive director representation up 30%, 
emerging talent with vice president representation 
up 17% and student talent up 7%. To encourage 
dialogue and engage our people, more than 85,000 
employees were invited to participate in ABL 
Dialogues — a series of interactive panel discus-
sions facilitated by local leaders in 10 U.S. strategic 
hubs. 

We recently developed a few additional plans and 
goals for this effort, which we believe will improve 
these results dramatically. 

17

5.  Transparency, financial discipline and a fortress balance sheet. Why is this discipline  

so important? 

Our bank operates in a complex and some-
times volatile world. We must maintain a 
fortress balance sheet if we want to contin-
ually invest and support our clients through 
thick and thin. A fortress balance sheet 
also means clear, comprehensive, accurate 
financial and operational reporting so we can 
properly manage the company, particularly 
through difficult times.

We are fanatical about measuring our results 
— financial and operational. We set targets for 
ourselves, and we always compare ourselves with 
our competitors. 
These targets are what we hope to achieve 
over the medium term and after making 
proper investments for the future, such as 
adding bankers and enhancing technology. 
The chart below shows that we generally 
compare well with our best-in-class peers (we 
never expect to be best-in-class every year

The chart below and the one on page 20 
show the extraordinary strength of our 
balance sheet. We have always believed 
that maintaining a strong balance sheet 
(including liquidity and conservative 
accounting) is an absolute necessity. 

We have said this before, and it remains 
true: JPMorgan Chase has to be prepared to 
handle multiple, complex, global and interre-
lated types of risk. We do this in many ways 
– let me share a few:

The Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress 
test estimated what our losses would be 
through a severely adverse event lasting over 
nine quarters – an event that is worse than 
what actually happened during the Great 
Recession; e.g., high unemployment and

The chart above shows just how much 
capital is retained by the CCAR banks.  
To remind you, CCAR forecasts the losses 
of each bank over the next nine quarters as 
if all of them went through a crisis worse 
than the crisis in 2009 and that each bank 
performed as poorly as the worst bank 
throughout that crisis. The chart above also 
shows that even in the extremely unlikely 
event that it could happen this way (i.e., 
that each bank is the worst bank), there is 
plenty of capital in the system to absorb 
these events. This does not include the 
fact that the new regulatory requirements 
would appropriately force any bank to take 
corrective action long before it gets into 
serious trouble. 

counterparty failures. The Fed estimated 
that in such a scenario, we would lose $18 
billion over the ensuing nine quarters, which 
is easily manageable by JPMorgan Chase’s 
capital base. My view is that we would 
make money in almost every quarter in that 
scenario, and this is supported by our having 
earned approximately $30 billion pre-tax 
over the course of the nine quarters during 
the actual financial crisis of 2009. 

We are believers in the CCAR stress testing 
process, although our view is that it could 
be simplified and improved. Our share-
holders should know that the CCAR stress 
test is only an annual test. To explain 
how serious we are about stress testing, 
you should know that we run several 
hundred tests a week – including a number 
of complicated, potentially disastrous 
scenarios – to prepare our company for 
almost every type of event. While we never 
know exactly how and when the next major 
crisis will unfold, these rigorous exercises 
keep us constantly prepared.

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES 6.  What risks worry us the most? And what could go wrong?

The global economy across Asia and Japan, 
Latin America and Europe, and the United 
States has been doing well – better than most 
would have expected a year ago. The United 
States in particular may be strengthening 
as we speak. The competitive tax system, 
a more constructive regulatory environ-
ment, and very high consumer and business 
confidence are increasing indications that 
the economy will likely expand. Unemploy-
ment may very well drop to 3.5% this year, 
and there are more and more signals that 
business will improve capital expenditures 
and raise payrolls. Credit is readily available 
(though still not enough in some mort-
gage markets). Wages, jobs and household 
formation are increasing. Housing is in short 
supply. Underlying consumer and corpo-
rate credit have been relatively strong. All 
these signs lead to a positive outlook for the 
economy for the next year or so.

I will not spend time dwelling on geopolitics 
here, which can – but rarely does – upset the 
global economy. In the next section, I talk 
about serious policy issues that could harm 
economic growth, including America’s rela-
tionship with China and potential disrup-
tions to global trade. In this section, I focus 
on some of the risks in the financial system 
and how we go about managing them.

We will be prepared for Brexit. 
So far, it has turned out pretty much like we 
expected: It’s complex and hard to figure 
out, and the long-term impact to the United 
Kingdom is still uncertain. Last year, we 
spoke about whether Brexit would cause the 
European Union to unravel or pull together 
– and it appears, particularly with the new 
leadership in France and the steady hand 
in Germany, that the countries might pull 
together. As for JPMorgan Chase, fortunately, 
we have the resources to be prepared for 
a hard Brexit, as we must be. It essentially 
means moving 300-400 jobs around Europe 
in the short term and modifying some of our 
legal entities to be able to conduct business 
the day after Brexit. What we do not know 
– and will not know until the negotiations 

are complete – is what the end state will 
look like. Although unlikely, there is the 
possibility that we could stay exactly as we 
are today. Unfortunately, the worst outcome 
would be much of London’s financial center 
moving to the Continent over time. We hope 
for all involved that this outcome will not be 
the case.

We cannot do enough as a country when it comes 
to cybersecurity.
I cannot overemphasize the importance of 
cybersecurity in America. This is a critical 
issue, not just for financial companies but 
also for utilities, technology companies, elec-
trical grids and others. It is an arms race, and 
we need to do whatever we can to protect the 
United States of America.

Our bank is extremely good at cybersecurity 
and client protection. However, cyber law 
in the United States is inadequate regarding 
banks and government entities. We need 
to be allowed to work even closer with our 
government in real time to properly protect 
the financial system. In addition, we need 
to have better international cyber laws (and 
include them in trade agreements) like we 
do in maritime and aviation laws. Countries 
should know what they are responsible for 
– and what redress companies or countries 
have – when either a bad state actor or crimi-
nals in a state cause extreme problems.

In the financial markets, we must be prepared for 
the full range of possibilities and probabilities.
We strive to try to understand the possibili-
ties and probabilities of potential outcomes 
so as to be prepared for any outcome. We 
analyze multiple scenarios (in addition to 
the stress testing I wrote about earlier in 
this section). So regardless of what you 
think about the probabilities, we need to be 
prepared for the possibilities, including the 
worst case. In essence, we try to manage the 
company such that all possibilities, including 
the “fat tails” (the worst-case scenarios), 
cannot hurt the company.

21

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIESWe try to intelligently, thoughtfully and 
analytically make decisions and manage risk  
(and not overly rely on models).
When I hear people talk about banks taking 
risks, it often sounds as if we are taking 
big bets like you would at a casino or a 
racetrack. This is the complete opposite of 
reality. Every loan we extend is a proprietary 
risk. Every new facility we build is a risk. 
Whether we are adding branches or bankers 
– or making markets or expanding opera-
tions – we perform extensive analytics and 
stress testing to challenge our assumptions. 
In short, we look at the best- and worst-case 
scenarios before we “take risk.” Much of what 
we do as a bank is to mitigate or manage 
the risk being taken. I think you would be 
impressed by the thoroughness and risk-mit-
igating approach demonstrated at our risk 
committee meetings. At these meetings, 
we have lawyers, compliance, risk manage-
ment, bankers and technologists – folks with 
decades of experience who challenge each 
other and ensure we have thought about 
every possible angle. And since we know we 
will be wrong sometimes, we almost always 
look at the worst possible case – to ensure 
JPMorgan Chase can survive any situation. 
This is not risk taking on the order of taking 
a guess – it is intelligent, thoughtful, analyt-
ical decision making.

We rely heavily on detailed and constantly 
improving models as a foundational element 
of that analysis. But we are cognizant of 
the fact that models by their nature are 
backward looking and have a difficult time 
adjusting to material items, including the 
following: 

•  The character and integrity of those with 

whom you are doing business

•  Changing technology as it impacts indus-

tries (including the banking industry)

•  Future changes in the law or even how 

the law might be interpreted differently 10 
years from now

•  Deteriorating international competiveness 

(as what happened to our tax code)

22

•  Emerging competitive threats

•  Changes in industrial structure; e.g., new 

sources of competition 

•  Political influence and unexpected litigation

•  Public sector fiscal challenges, demo-

graphic changes and challenges managing 
the nation’s healthcare resources

There are other items – but you get the point. 
Judgment (which will never be perfect all of 
the time) cannot be removed from the process.

Volatility and rapidly moving markets should 
surprise no one.
We are always prepared for volatility and 
rapidly moving markets – they should 
surprise no one. I am a little perplexed when 
people are surprised by large market moves. 
Oftentimes, it takes only an unexpected 
supply/demand imbalance of a few percent 
and changing sentiment to dramatically 
move markets. We have seen that condition 
occur recently in oil, but I have also seen it 
multiple times in my career in cotton, corn, 
aluminum, soybeans, chicken, beef, copper, 
iron – you get the point. Each industry or 
commodity has continually changing supply 
and demand, different investment horizons 
to add or subtract supply, varying marginal 
and fixed costs, and different inventory and 
supply lines. In all cases, extreme volatility 
can be created by slightly changing factors. 

It is fundamentally the same for stocks, 
bonds, and interest rates and currencies. 
Changing expectations, whether around 
inflation, growth or recession (yes, there will 
be another recession – we just don’t know 
when), supply and demand, sentiment and 
other factors, can cause drastic volatility.

One scenario that we must be prepared for is 
the possibility that the reversal of quantitative 
easing (QE) by the world’s central banks — in a 
new regulatory environment — will be different 
from what people expect. 
The United States has had subpar economic 
growth over the last eight years (I believe this 
is due to a lot of poor policy decisions that I 
discuss in the next section), as well as new 

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES demographic realities. Our growth cumula-
tively in this expansion has been about 20%, 
while a more normal recovery would have 
seen growth of over 40% by now. However, 
with recent reforms, the situation may be 
improving. As inflation, wages and growth 
seem to be modestly increasing, the Federal 
Reserve has started to raise interest rates and 
reverse QE. Importantly, as long as rates are 
rising because the economy is strengthening 
and inflation is contained, it is reasonable 
to expect that the reversal of QE will not be 
painful. The benefits of a strong economy 
are more important than the negative impact 
from modest increases in interest rates. 

Since QE has never been done on this scale 
and we don’t completely know the myriad 
effects it has had on asset prices, confidence, 
capital expenditures and other factors, we 
cannot possibly know all of the effects of its 
reversal. We have to deal with the possibility 
that at one point, the Federal Reserve and 
other central banks may have to take more 
drastic action than they currently antici-
pate – reacting to the markets, not guiding 
the markets. A simple scenario under which 
this could happen is if inflation and wages 
grow more than people expect. I believe that 
many people underestimate the possibility 
of higher inflation and wages, which means 
they might be underestimating the chance 
that the Federal Reserve may have to raise 
rates faster than we all think. While in the 
past, interest rates have been lower and 
for longer than people expected, they may 
go higher and faster than people expect. If 
this happens, it is useful to look at how the 
table is set – what are all the things that are 
different or better or worse than during prior 
crises, particularly the last one – and try to 
think through the possible effects.

There are many pluses (things that are better 
than during the last crisis in 2009):

•  Far more capital and less leverage in the 

banking system

•  Far more liquidity in the banking system

•  More collateral in the markets

•  Less total short-term secured financing, 

which is also more properly collateralized

•  Less leveraged lending

•  Money market funds that are far safer due 

to regulatory requirements around credit 
standards and liquidation

•  Healthier consumers in terms of both 

employment and disposable income (and 
their debt burden is still modest relative 
to their disposable income, while debt 
service burdens are historically low)

•  The absence of massive losses in the 

mortgage markets. Mortgage underwriting 
since 2009 has been rather pristine. And 
while losses will go up in a recession, it 
will be nothing like what happened in the 
Great Recession. In the 2009 crisis, losses 
totaled more than $1 trillion. The market-
place realization that financial institutions 
and investors were going to experience 
massive losses is a primary reason why 
there was a devastating loss of confidence 
in the financial system.

And there are some modest negatives or 
potentially important differences (than 
during the last crisis):

•  Far more money than before (about $9 tril-
lion of assets, which represents about 30% 
of total mutual fund long-term assets) is 
managed passively in index funds or ETFs 
(both of which are very easy to get out 
of). Some of these funds provide far more 
liquidity to the customer than the under-
lying assets in the fund, and it is reason-
able to worry about what would happen if 
these funds went into large liquidation.

23

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES•  Even more procyclicality has been built 

into the system. Risk-weighted assets will 
go up as will collateral requirements – and 
this is on top of the procyclicality of loan 
loss reserving.

•  Market making is dramatically smaller than 

in the past (e.g., aggregate primary dealer 
positions of bonds – including Treasury 
and agency securities, mortgage-backed 
securities and corporates – averaged 
$530 billion in 2007 vs. an average of 
$179 billion today). While in the past that 
total may have been too high, virtually 
every asset manager says today it is much 
harder to buy and sell securities, particu-
larly the less liquid securities.

•  Liquidity requirements, while much 

higher, now have an element of rigidity 
built in that did not exist before. Banks 
will be unable to use that liquidity when 
they most need to do so – to make loans 
or intermediate markets. They have a “red 
line” they cannot cross (they are required 
to maintain hard and fast liquidity 
requirements). As clients demand more 
liquidity from their banks, the banks 
essentially will be unable to provide it.

•  There has been an excessive reliance on 
models (which I spoke about earlier in 
this section).

•  The continuous politicization of complex 

policy is an issue. No one can believe 
that very detailed and complex global 
liquidity or capital requirements should 
be set by politicians. 

•  No banks to the rescue this time – banks 

got punished for helping in the last 
go-round.

It would be a reasonable expectation 
that with normal growth and inflation 
approaching 2%, the 10-year bond could 
or should be trading at around 4%. And 
the short end should be trading at around 
2½% (these would be fairly normal histor-
ical experiences). And this is still a little 
lower than the Fed is forecasting under 
these conditions. It is also a reasonable 
explanation (and one that many economists 
believe) that today’s rates of the 10-year 
bond trading below 3% are due to the 
large purchases of U.S. debt by the Federal 
Reserve (and others). 

This situation is completely reversing. 
Sometime in the next year or so, many of 
the major buyers of U.S. debt, including 
the Federal Reserve, will either stop their 
buying or reverse their purchases (think 
foreign exchange managers or central banks 
in Japan or China and Europe). So far, only 
one central bank, the Federal Reserve, has 
started to reverse QE – and even that in a 
minor way. However, by the end of this year, 
the Fed has indicated it might reduce its 
holding of Treasuries by up to $150 billion 
a quarter. And finally, the U.S. government 
will need to sell more than $250 billion a 
quarter to fund its deficit. 

There are two offsetting factors to the large 
sales of Treasuries. One is that as the Federal 
Reserve sells, it reduces excess reserves, 
which requires banks to buy Treasuries to 
meet liquidity requirements. But we do not 
fully know the extent of this scenario, and 
it certainly won’t be dollar for dollar. The 
second factor, as some argue, is that the U.S. 
trade deficit effectively forces foreign coun-
tries to use their dollars to buy Treasuries, 
although this is not completely true – they 
can buy other U.S. securities or assets or sell 
their dollars.

So we could be going into a situation where 
the Fed will have to raise rates faster and/
or sell more securities, which certainly could 
lead to more uncertainty and market vola-
tility. Whether this would lead to a reces-
sion or not, we don’t know – but even that 

24

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES is not the worst case. If growth in America 
is accelerating, which it seems to be, and 
any remaining slack in the labor markets 
is disappearing – and wages start going up, 
as do commodity prices – then it is not an 
unreasonable possibility that inflation could 
go higher than people might expect. As a 
result, the Federal Reserve will also need 
to raise rates faster and higher than people 
might expect. In this case, markets will get 
more volatile as all asset prices adjust to 
a new and maybe not-so-positive environ-
ment. Remember that former Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker increased 
the discount rate by 100 basis points on a 
Saturday night back in 1979 in response to a 
serious double-digit inflation problem. And 
when markets opened the next business 
day, the Fed funds rate went up by over 200 
basis points. Also remember that the Federal 
Reserve is operating with extremely different 
monetary transmission mechanisms than 
in the past. The old “money multiplier” has 
been superseded by the new capital and 
liquidity requirements. Today’s “excess 
reserves” (reserves once considered in 
excess of what banks were required to post 
in cash at the Federal Reserve – fundamen-
tally reserves that could be lent out) are not 
lendable, although we still don’t completely 
understand the effect of this. 

There is a risk that volatile and declining markets 
can lead to market panic.
Financial markets have a life of their own 
and are sometimes barely connected to the 
real economy (most people don’t pay much 
attention to the financial markets nor do the 
markets affect them very much). Volatile 
markets and/or declining markets gener-
ally have been a reaction to the economic 
environment. Most of the major downturns 
in the market since the Great Depression 
reflect negative future expectations due to a 
potential or real recession. In almost all of 
these cases, stock markets fell, credit losses 
increased and credit spreads rose, among 
other disruptions. The biggest negative 
effect of volatile markets is that it can create 
market panic, which could start to slow the 
growth of the real economy. The years 1929 

and 2009 are the only real examples in the 
United States in the past 100 years when 
panic in the markets caused large reduc-
tions in investments and hiring. I wouldn’t 
give this scenario very high odds – in fact, I 
would give it low odds. Most people think of 
those events as one-in-a-thousand-year floods. 
But because the experience of 2009 is so 
recent, there is always a chance that people 
may overreact.

If truly negative events started to unfold, we 
could expect the Federal Reserve, with its 
enormous authority and power, to take strong 
action, including changing regulations, if the 
Fed thought it necessary. In any event, our 
shareholders should rest assured that we will 
weather it all. There are a couple of things 
we all could do to be more prepared for this 
situation and other disruptions, which I will 
discuss in the next few paragraphs.

Banks and regulators need to be more forward 
looking and less backward looking — particularly 
when examining risks across the system. 
One day there will be another crisis, and 
financial institutions and central banks will 
need to respond. The financial system is far 
more safe and sound than in the past. But 
in spite of all the regulations put in place, 
I worry about whether we have properly 
prepared for the next crisis. The Financial 
Stability Oversight Council was created to 
oversee the whole system (as appropriate), 
but we have not yet really worked collabo-
ratively to prepare tabletop exercises about 
what would happen across the system under 
difficult situations.

When the next crisis begins, regardless of 
where or how it starts, multiple actors in the 
system will take actions – either out of neces-
sity (i.e., they need cash) or sentiment (i.e., 
they want to reduce risk). This will happen 
across passive, index and ETF funds, insur-
ance companies, banks and nonbanks. As 
individual actors stop providing credit and 
liquidity in the marketplace, we need to do a 
better job of understanding how this might 
unfold. And all this will be happening under 
a different regulatory regime from before. 

25

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIESWe also need to be more forward looking 
in many other areas. Doing so will create a 
better and stronger system – not doing so 
will actually create additional risk. Following 
are a few examples:

Almost all risk and control functions 
(think Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your 
Customer (KYC) and Compliance) could 
be better performed if we worked with the 
regulators to streamline what we do and use 
advanced techniques, like artificial intelli-
gence and machine learning, to improve the 
outcomes. The same is true for fraud preven-
tion and customer service. We must also be 
far more aggressive in protecting ourselves 
from cybersecurity risks, both within the 
banking system and across the financial 
system (think of nonbanks, money managers, 
clearinghouses, exchanges, etc.) 

Modest regulatory reform can strengthen the 
financial system, improve the functioning of  
our markets and enhance economic growth for  
all Americans.
While the regulatory environment is appro-
priately much stricter than it once was, we 
can simplify it and even strengthen it by 
ensuring that it is globally fair and trans-
parent and includes continuous, regular 
review and appropriate modification. 

Regulators now have begun to simplify, coor-
dinate and reduce overlapping regulations. 
I won’t repeat the details that I’ve discussed 
in prior letters – many of them were also 
discussed in Treasury reports issued by the 
government. But suffice it to say, modest 
regulatory reform could allow banks to 
expand carefully, improve access to credit 
(e.g., mortgages and small business loans) 
and improve market making and the func-
tioning of the money markets. 

7.  How is the company dealing with bureaucracy and complacency that often infect  

large companies? 

I was recently at a senior leadership offsite 
meeting talking about bureaucracy. We 
heard bureaucracy described as “a necessary 
outcome of complex businesses operating 
in complex international and regulatory 
environments.” This is hogwash. Bureau-
cracy is a disease. Bureaucracy drives out 
good people, slows down decision making, 
kills innovation and is often the petri dish of 
bad politics. Large organizations, in fact all 
organizations, should be thought of as always 
slowing down and getting more bureaucratic. 
Therefore, leaders must continually drive 
for speed and accuracy to eliminate waste 
and kill bureaucracy. When you get in great 
shape, you don’t stop exercising.

After years of increasing regulations, there 
has been a temptation to blame some of our 
bureaucracy and ridiculous processes on 
regulations. That, too, is (mostly) hogwash. 
It is easy to find excuses not to attempt to 
reimagine how things could be done better 
and more efficiently.

Below are five examples of how we’ve set out 
to combat this condition:

Meetings. Internal meetings can be a giant 
waste of time and money. I am a vocal propo-
nent of having fewer of them. If a meeting 
is absolutely necessary, the organizer needs 
to have a well-planned, focused agenda with 
pre-read materials sent in advance. The 
right people have to be in the room, and 
follow-up actions must be well-documented. 
Just as important, each meeting should 
only run for as long as it needs to and lead 

26

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES to real decisions. In addition, there should 
be clarity around who chairs the meeting. 
The chair is responsible for making sure all 
issues are properly raised, facilitating effec-
tive and productive discussions and driving 
to decisions. 

War rooms. Just as important, we need to 
simplify our processes while accelerating the 
pace of change and driving new innovations. 
Last year, the Operating Committee created 
a number of “war rooms” – spanning lines of 
business, geographies, functions and levels 
– to make our firm more agile and to put a 
laser focus on several hot-button issues, like 
client onboarding and vendor and third-
party management. Each war room is staffed 
with a dedicated group of employees tasked 
with solving specific problems within a set 
number of weeks or months. You would be 
amazed at how quickly our employees can 
come up with new solutions when they are 
galvanized around solving a problem in a 
concentrated time period. These teams have 
been so successful in driving bureaucracy 
out of the decision-making process that we 
plan to deploy more war rooms when crit-
ical needs arise. These war rooms are very 
similar to how we operated when we made 
complex acquisitions. Essentially, they cause 
better and faster dissemination of infor-
mation to those who need to know – and 
faster and more productive decision making 
because everyone involved is in the room.

Reimagining. You can take any part of your 
business and reimagine it. You can get 
all the right people in the room to think 
about a certain process and reimagine how 
it could be done from the ground up. Our 
Know Your Customer problem-solving team 
is a good example of the results our reimag-
ining and war rooms can drive. Comprising 
all lines of business, the group was given 
eight weeks to reimagine our KYC processes 
to improve the customer experience without 
sacrificing controls. By applying a sharp, 
firmwide focus to the KYC protocols, the 

team identified several KYC questions and 
protocols that had become outdated or been 
made redundant by recent controls. One 
customer could be subjected to multiple 
KYC processes depending on the line of 
business and channel used. As a result, the 
team streamlined KYC questions substan-
tially and identified a number of processes 
that could be eliminated, which will allow 
for a better customer experience while still 
maintaining a strong control environment. 
This war room team’s results not only 
helped disparate lines of business identify 
duplicative processes but also enabled the 
team to update the firm’s priorities. 

Fighting complacency by being self-critical. 
Complacency is another disease. It is usually 
borne out of arrogance or success, but it is a 
guarantee of future failure. Our competitors 
are not resting on their laurels – nor can 
we. The only way to fight complacency is to 
always analyze our own actions and point 
out our own weaknesses. It’s great to openly 
celebrate our successes, but when the door 
is closed, management should emphasize 
the negatives.

Using agile management to create speed. 
Agile technology generally means using 
new forms of technology – think cloud 
computing, for example – to enable small 
teams of programmers to build and prop-
erly execute new programs and products 
rapidly and effectively. The concept of agile 
management goes hand in hand with this 
approach. Small teams of people respon-
sible for products and services work with 
technologists to improve the customer  
experience. To do this, they must be given 
the necessary authority and resources. It is 
also important they understand that they 
can make mistakes without punishment.

Having a first-rate management team in 
place is probably the Board’s highest priority. 
Therefore, management succession planning 
is a key focus of our Board. The Board knows 
the firm’s senior leaders well, through unfet-
tered access and significant interaction. 

While the Board and I have agreed that I 
will continue in my current role for approxi-
mately five more years, we both believe that, 
under all timing scenarios, the firm has in 
place several highly capable successors. 

Early in the year, we announced that Daniel 
Pinto, CEO of our Corporate & Investment 
Bank, and Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer 
& Community Banking, have been appointed 
Co-Presidents and Chief Operating Officers 
of the company. In addition to their current 

roles, Daniel and Gordon will work closely 
with me to help drive critical firmwide func-
tions. Our other outstanding CEOs, Mary 
Erdoes, Asset & Wealth Management, and 
Doug Petno, Commercial Banking, along with 
our CFO, Marianne Lake, took on expanded 
responsibilities last year and have played 
progressively more significant roles part-
nering across the firm in helping to manage 
the company. I also want to say how grateful 
I am to our Operating Committee and to all 
of the leaders of our organization for the 
extraordinary job they do.

I.  JPMORGAN CHASE BUSINESS STRATEGIES II. PUBLIC POLICY

The following messages are worth repeating 
from last year’s letter: The United States 
needs to ensure that we maintain a healthy 
and vibrant economy. This is what fuels 
job creation, raises the standard of living 
and creates opportunity for those who are 
hurting, while positioning us to invest in 
education, technology and infrastructure 
– in a programmatic and sustainable way 
– to build a better and safer future for our 
country and its people. And in a world with 
so many security threats and challenges, we 
need to maintain the best military. Amer-
ica’s military will be the best in the world 
only as long as we have the best economy  
in the world. 

Business plays a critical role as an engine of 
economic growth – particularly our largest, 
globally competitive American businesses. 
As an example, the 1,000 largest compa-
nies in America (out of approximately 29 
million) employ nearly 30 million people 
in the United States, and nearly all of their 
full-time employees receive full medical 
and retirement benefits, as well as exten-
sive training. In addition, these companies 
account for more than 30% of the roughly 
$2.3 trillion spent annually on capital expen-
ditures. These expenditures and research and 
development spending drive productivity 
and innovation, which, ultimately, drive job 
creation across the entire economy. 

Of the approximately 150 million people 
who work in the United States, 130 million 
work in private enterprise. We hold in high 
regard the 20 million people employed by 
the government or in the public sector – 
teachers, police officers, firefighters and 
others. But we could not pay for those jobs 
if the other 130 million workers were not 
actively producing America’s gross domestic 
product (GDP). 

Small businesses are a critical engine of 
economic growth. Small and large busi-
nesses are symbiotic – they are each other’s 
customers, and they help drive each other’s 
growth. They are integral to our large busi-
ness ecosystem. At JPMorgan Chase, for 
example, we support more than 4 million 
small business clients, including hundreds of 
small banks, 15,000 middle market compa-
nies, and approximately 7,000 corporations 
and investor clients. Additionally, we rely on 
services from nearly 30,000 vendors, many 
of which are small and midsized companies. 

Business, taken as a whole, is the source of 
almost all job creation. And we need to main-
tain trust and confidence in our businesses 
as in all of our institutions. Confidence is a 
“secret sauce” that costs nothing, but it helps 
the economy grow. A strong and vibrant 
private sector (including big companies) is 
good for the average American. Entrepre-
neurship and free enterprise, with strong 
ethics and high standards, are something to 
root for – not attack.

To support this, we need a pro-growth policy 
environment from the government that 
provides a degree of certainty around long-
standing issues that have proved frustrat-
ingly elusive to solve. The most pressing 
areas where government, business and 
other stakeholders can find common ground 
should include tax reform, infrastructure 
investment, education reform, more favor-
able trade agreements and a sensible immi-
gration policy.

Let’s take another look at what is holding us 
back and some solutions that could make life 
better for all Americans.

29

1.  What has gone wrong in public policy? 

In the last several years, I have spent a good 
amount of time – in both these letters and 
elsewhere – talking about public policy. 
Some of the policies directly relate to 
JPMorgan Chase, while others are more indi-
rect but have a large effect on the future of 
the United States of America, on the global 
economy and, therefore, on our company. 
With all of America’s exceptional strengths, 
it seems clear to me that something is 
holding us back. As we have already pointed 
out, our economic growth has been anemic. 
Our economy has grown approximately 20% 
in the last eight years, but this stands in 
contrast with prior average recoveries where 
growth would have been more than 40% 
over an eight-year period. The chart below  
on the left shows this.

Last year, I laid out in detail an extensive list 
of things I thought were holding us back, and 
it bears repeating here because, just as it took 
many years for these obstacles to develop, it 
is going to take sustained effort over many 
years to right the course. When you look at 
this list in totality, it is significant and fairly 
shocking. Most of these areas have become 
consistently worse over the last 10 to 20 
years, and it is hard to argue that they did not 
meaningfully damage the country’s economic 
growth. It is also important to point out that 
I have never seen an economic model that 
accounts for the extremely damaging aspects 
of these items. (These items don’t include the 
trillions of dollars we have spent on war-re-
lated expenditures. And whether you were 
for or against these wars, they certainly did 
not add to American productivity.) This is not 
secular stagnation – this represents senseless 
and misguided policies.

II.  PUBLIC POLICY •  We had a hugely and increasingly uncom-

•  Our schools are leaving too many behind. 

petitive tax system driving companies’ 
capital and brainpower overseas.

•  Excessive regulations for both large and 

small companies reduced growth and 
business formation. The ease of starting 
a business in the United States worsened, 
with small business formation dropping to 
the lowest rate in 30 years.

•  The chart on the bottom right of page 

In some inner city schools, fewer than 
60% of students graduate, and of those 
who do, a significant number are not 
prepared for employment. Additionally, 
many of our high schools, vocational 
schools and community colleges do not 
properly prepare today’s younger gener-
ation for the available professional-level 
jobs, many of which pay a multiple of the 
minimum wage.

30 shows how tepid bank credit growth 
was in general during this recovery. 
Remember, bank credit growth directly 
relates to economic growth, although it’s 
often difficult to figure out the cause and 
effect. But there is no question that the 
things that reduce credit availability, in 
turn, reduce growth. One area where we 
know this happened was in the mortgage 
market. Household formation has been 
slow because many young adults have had 
a difficult time finding work and, with the 
help of their families, have gone back for 
more schooling. That is slowly reversing. 
But the inability to reform mortgage 
markets has dramatically reduced mort-
gage availability. In fact, our analysis 
shows that, conservatively, more than  
$1 trillion in mortgage loans might have 
been made over a five-year period. 

•  Labor force participation – particularly 

among men aged 25-54 – dropped dramat-
ically. An estimated 2 million Americans 
are currently addicted to opioids (in 
2016, a staggering 42,000 Americans died 
because of opioid overdoses), and some 
studies show this is one of the major 
reasons why men aged 25-54 are perma-
nently out of work. Even worse, 70% of 
today’s youth (ages 17-24) are not eligible 
for military service, essentially due to a 
lack of proper education (basic reading 
and writing skills) or health issues (often 
obesity or diabetes).

•  Infrastructure is a disaster. It took eight 

years to get a man to the moon (from idea 
inception to completion), yet it now can 
sometimes take a decade to simply get the 
permits to build a bridge or a new solar 
field. The country that used to have the 
best infrastructure on the planet by most 
measures is now not even ranked among 
the top 20 developed nations according to 
the Basic Requirement Index.

•  Our immigration policies fail us in 

numerous ways. Forty percent of foreign 
students who receive advanced degrees 
in science, technology and math (300,000 
students annually) have no legal way of 
staying here, although many would choose 
to do so. Most students from countries 
outside the United States pay full freight 
to attend our universities but many are 
forced to take the training back home. 
From my vantage point, that means one of 
our largest exports is brainpower.

•  Our nation’s healthcare costs are twice the 

amount per person compared with most 
developed nations. 

•  Our litigation system is increasingly  

arbitrary, capricious, wasteful and slow. 

31

II.  PUBLIC POLICYEconomic analysis provides a sense of the 
costs associated with misguided policies. The 
Congressional Budget Office estimates the 
cost of failing to pass immigration reform 
earlier this decade at 0.3% of GDP a year. An 
International Monetary Fund study suggests 
that a 1% of GDP rise in infrastructure 
investment in 2013 would have delivered a 
similar boost to advanced economy GDP over 
the subsequent decade. J.P. Morgan analysis 
indicates that the cost of not reforming the 
mortgage markets could be as high as 0.2% 
of GDP a year. Taken together with the costs 
of excessive regulation and a depressed 
prime age labor participation rate, it is easy 
to conclude that corrections in policy could 
add more than 1% of GDP annually. And this 
does not account for many of the items I 
mentioned in the prior list.

The end result is that our economy is still 
leaving many behind. Much of this is 
probably self-inflicted. While a job used to 
provide a ticket to the middle class, today 
more people are getting stuck in low-wage 
work. Historically, we’ve thought of these 
jobs as providing the first rung on a career 

ladder – a chance for workers to prove them-
selves and develop skills before moving on 
to other, better paying jobs. But a growing 
number of Americans are left hanging on 
this first rung: During the mid-1990s, only 
one in five minimum-wage workers was still 
at minimum wage a year later. Today, that 
number is nearly one in three. 

So while the economy has not performed 
badly and has done amazingly well for a 
handful – low-skilled and even middle-skilled 
wages have gone down, leaving large swaths 
of Americans behind. 

It is surprising that many younger people in 
the United States, who are effectively going 
to inherit the wealthiest nation on the planet, 
seem to be pessimistic about our future 
and capitalism. But falling expectations, the 
failure of our economy to lift up everyone, 
and the continual deprecation of society 
and its leaders have led to huge amounts of 
discontent and unrest. 

All these issues are fixable, but we should 
ask ourselves how we got it wrong in the 
first place.

2.  Poor public policy  — how has this happened?

America has been an amazingly resilient 
country. And we hope it will reset and get 
back on track. But it is hard to look at the 
last 20 years and not think that it has been 
getting increasingly worse (and we should 
not assume that it will get better on its own). 
Before we try to address what we can do to 
fix it, it is important to look at why it has 
gotten worse. Here are my theories:

•  The world is getting faster and more 

complex, making speed and analytics all 
the more important. But the structure of 
our political parties and institutions has 
barely changed in 100 years. They may not 
be set up for success – organized in a way to 
enable them to deal with today’s challenges.

•  Critical thinking, analysis of facts and 
proper policy formation have become 
extremely difficult in a politicized and 

media-saturated environment. Often,  
politics misuses facts to justify a position.

•  We are effectively crippled when it 

comes to fixing our problems even when 
they are totally predictable. Puerto 
Rico’s bankruptcy, Detroit’s bankruptcy, 
unfunded pension plans, the job skills 
gap, and crumbling bridges and tunnels 
are prime examples.

•  We focus too much on the short term. 

For example, President Bill Clinton (and 
I don’t mean to pick him out specifically) 
usually gets credit for driving a strong 
economy. But the excessive mortgage 
lending, incented and promulgated by 
the federal government (I am in no way 
saying that banks and investors didn’t 
play a part, too), is part of the reason the 
economy at that time did well. It blew up 

32

II.  PUBLIC POLICY late in President George W. Bush’s term. 
There are many examples of presidents 
getting credit or blame for scenarios that 
had nothing to do with their governing. 
We simply learned the wrong lessons. And 
in the short run, we tend to simplistically 
look for scapegoats instead of solutions. 

•  Rogoff and Reinhart wrote in their book, 
This Time Is Different, that it takes a long 
time to recover from a financial crisis. But 
this was often due to poor policy or over-
reaction to the financial crisis, and while 
history teaches us that maybe we should 
expect this reaction in the next crisis, it 
does not have to be true over and over. We 
have a difficult time learning from the past. 

•  A famous politician once said, “Don’t let a 

good crisis go to waste.” I think he really 
meant, “Let’s use the crisis to get some 
good, important things done.” It appears 

that politicians sometimes use a crisis to 
justify implementing their own agenda.

•  Here’s another example: We all know that 

the U.S. healthcare system needs to be 
reformed. Many have advocated getting 
on the path to universal healthcare for all 
Americans. The creation of Obamacare, 
while a step in the right moral direc-
tion, was not well done. America has 
290 million people who have insurance 
– 180 million through private enterprise 
and 110 million through Medicare and 
Medicaid. Obamacare slightly expanded 
both and created exchanges that insure 
10 million people. But it did very little 
to fix our broken healthcare system and 
has, in fact, torn up the body politic over 
10 years – and this tumult may go on for 
another 10 years.

3.  We can fix this problem through intelligent, thoughtful, analytical and comprehensive policy. 

First off, we should find it rather easy to 
recognize that bad thinking often leads to bad 
policymaking. Let me list a few of the culprits:

•  Binary arguments. When people argue as 
if there are binary solutions, the argument 
is almost always wrong. When people say 
you should not do something because it 
is like going down a “slippery slope,” it 
generally is not a good argument. In the 
modern world, there are reasons to cali-
brate various parts of policy instead of just 
denying the argument altogether.

•  “They complain too much” arguments. 

When a point has been made and someone 
calls it a complaint, the point is diminished 
right away. When someone complains 
about something, a better response is to 
think about where or how the person 
might be right or partially right.

•  Not listening to one another. I tell my 
liberal friends to read columnists like 
Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell 
my conservative friends to read writers 
like Tom Friedman.

•  Not asking what outcomes you really want 

to achieve.

•  Not working with experts who know the 

most about a subject.

•  Trying to create too many zero-tolerance 

environments when they are often not 
merited. Examples include situations 
where people need to be able to commu-
nicate with each other and work through 
miscommunications and mistakes of judg-
ment rather than criminal and unethical 
behavior, where a zero-tolerance standard 
should be applied equally to all. 

•  This way of thinking also applies to institu-
tions. We should not destroy the credibility 
or the effectiveness of institutions – public 
or private – for the mistakes or misdeeds of 
a few. This may feel good in the short term 
but will not serve us well over the long term. 

We all generally know what a good  
decision-making process looks like – and  
we applaud it – whether in business or  
in Congress. 

33

II.  PUBLIC POLICY4.  The need for solutions through collaborative, competent government.

restoring public faith in two of our greatest 
democratic institutions in the United States: 
business and government. Working together 
will allow us to move toward a prosperous 
future for all Americans. 

Many examples of business and government 
working together already have produced 
positive outcomes. Businesses have played 
a large role in trying to help Detroit recover. 
Businesses started the Veteran Jobs Mission.
With a goal of 1 million jobs, the coalition 
of businesses has already helped 400,000 
U.S. veterans get work, and the number is 
still growing. Many businesses have worked 
closely with the education system (mostly 
locally) to support charter schools, voca-
tional schools and community colleges to 
provide skills training that prepares students 
for productive employment. We believe 
that collaboration can create even better 
outcomes in education, healthcare and job 
creation while shoring up pension plans and 
rebuilding our cities and communities across 
the nation. 

Our Founding Fathers studied and worked 
hard to design a strong and permanent 
democracy. They perfected a Constitution to 
protect our basic liberties, building in protec-
tions to temper some of our worst attributes 
and incent our best ones. If they were here 
with us today, I believe they would recognize 
that our government institutions are stuck 
in the mud – too slow and inadequate for 
the job at hand. Therefore, they would study 
and work hard within the Constitution to 
redesign and reformulate how government 
should function so that it works properly.  
We will eventually need to do the same.

People don’t think about the challenges in 
their everyday lives as being Democratic 
or Republican issues – and our political 
leaders need to stop thinking that way. We 
need a well-performing, competent govern-
ment to thrive as a nation. Clearly, there 
are things that only the government can 
do – and must do well – such as having a 
strong military and ensuring an efficient and 
properly functioning justice system. The 
federal government maintains most of our 
nation’s transportation systems, and we need 
state and local governments to do a good 
job in terms of education, policing and other 
important functions. Some argue that the 
government should be doing more. But when 
many Americans think of the government 
delivering services, they think of the endless 
bureaucracy and paperwork associated with 
the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Postal 
Service and the Department of Veterans 
Affairs – none of which would consistently 
get high marks. 

We all can agree that the lack of true collab-
oration and an unwillingness to address our 
most pressing policy issues have contributed 
to the divisive and polarized environment we 
have today. Certainly there is plenty of blame 
to go around on this front. However, rather 
than looking back, it now is more important 
than ever for the business community and 
government to come together to find mean-
ingful solutions. This cannot be done by 
government or business alone. 

By collaborating and applying some good old 
American can-do ingenuity, there is nothing 
we can’t accomplish. By working together, 
business, government and the nonprofit 
sector can ensure and maintain a healthy and 
vibrant economy into the future – creating 
jobs, fostering economic mobility and main-
taining sustainable economic growth. Ulti-
mately, this translates to an improved quality 
of life and greater financial security for those 
in the United States struggling to make ends 
meet. It also represents a significant step in 

34

II.  PUBLIC POLICY 5.  A competitive business tax system is a key pillar of a growth strategy. 

It isn’t easy to stay competitive in an increas-
ingly global marketplace, and national tax 
policy was one critical area where we were 
falling behind. Over the last 20 years, as 
the world reduced its tax rates, America did 
not. Our previous tax code was increasingly 
uncompetitive, overly complex, and loaded 
with special interest provisions that created 
winners and losers. This was driving down 
capital investment, reducing productivity 
and causing wages to remain stagnant. The 
good news is that the recent changes in the 
U.S. tax system have many of the key ingre-
dients to fuel economic expansion: a busi-
ness tax rate that will make the U.S. compet-
itive around the world; provisions to free 
U.S. companies to bring back profits earned 
overseas; and, importantly, tax relief for the 
middle class.

The passage of tax reform is critical because 
strong businesses create jobs and higher 
wages. Before tax reform was passed, 76% 
of the CEOs of leading U.S. companies said 
they would increase hiring if tax reform 
were enacted, and 82% would increase 
capital spending – and we already are seeing 
these effects. Hundreds of companies like 
ours are stepping up by investing in their 
employees and in initiatives to address  
challenges facing communities.

I must confess I don’t understand how 
anyone could believe an uncompetitive tax 
system would be good for the United States 
– whether the current economic environ-
ment was good or bad. The damage has 
been cumulative. Here is one example: A 
recent study by the accounting firm Ernst 
& Young found that under a 20% corporate 
income tax rate, U.S. companies would 

have acquired $1.2 trillion in cross-border 
assets during 2004-2016 instead of losing 
$510 billion in such assets to foreign buyers. 
Simply put, this means the United States 
would have kept 4,700 companies under U.S. 
ownership during the past 13 years if they 
had paid taxes at a rate competitive with 
other countries that have modernized their 
corporate tax codes. Today’s competitive 
U.S. corporate tax rate will reduce incentives 
for U.S. companies to relocate abroad or be 
purchased by foreign companies.

There is a reason why it has taken 30 years 
for comprehensive tax reform to take place 
in this country: It is complicated work, and 
navigating competing interests is hard. I 
am pleased that we did the right thing – not 
the easy thing. Congress took a historic step 
in 2017 to reform America’s broken and 
outdated tax code. Coming together to get 
that work done shows that we can take on 
tough issues that have been holding us back. 

I believe tax reform will have both short- 
and long-term benefits. In the short term, 
we already are seeing some companies 
increasing capital expenditures, hiring and 
raising wages. Of course, that will not be 
enough to offset all the immediate benefits 
associated with tax reform. Some argue that 
the added cash flow going to dividends and 
buybacks is a negative – it is not. It simply 
represents capital finding a higher and better 
use than the current owner has with it. And 
that higher and better use will be reinvest-
ment in companies, innovation, R&D or 
consumption. Thinking this is a bad thing is 
just wrong. Tax reform’s real benefit will be 
the long-term cumulative effect of retained 
and reinvested capital in the United States, 
which means more companies, innovation 
and employment will stay in this country. 
The United States should always aim to have 
a competitive business tax system. It should 
not be traded off against other objectives. 

35

II.  PUBLIC POLICYHere is some news we announced on how JPMorgan Chase is immediately putting 
some of the benefits of tax reform to good work.

This is the right thing to do, and we believe it puts 
us well above the average hourly wage for most 
markets. These increases are on top of the value 
of the firm’s full benefits package, which averages 
$12,000 for employees in this pay range. But the 
improvements won’t stop there. We’re reducing 
medical plan deductibles by $750 per year for 
employees making less than $60,000 — this essen-
tially makes the deductible $0 for those employees 
who take care of themselves by meeting minimal 
wellness and preventative program requirements.

Credit is essential to a healthy economy and 
growth, and our new investments include sizable 
increases in lending to small businesses and 
homeowners. Through Commercial Banking and 
Business Banking, we will hire 500 new bankers 
and help expand small business lending by 20% — 
or $4 billion — over three years while entering new 
markets. We’re also doubling the investment in our 
Small Business Forward initiative to $150 million 
over five years to help provide small businesses run 
by women, minorities and veterans get both the 
capital and technical assistance they need to grow.

We will also help more families live their dream of 
owning a home by increasing home lending in low- 
and moderate-income communities by 25% — to  
$50 billion — over the next five years. To do so, 
we will hire up to 500 new Home Lending advisors 
across our current markets and in some new ones. In 
addition, we will increase lending to finance afford-
able rental housing to $7 billion over five years.

Today, our company is strong and growing, and 
when we grow, so do the communities where we do 
business. We’re excited to welcome new employees, 
new customers and new communities to JPMorgan 
Chase and to look forward to a bright future.

Along with a more constructive regulatory and 
business environment and our strong business 
performance, this reform has led our company  
to recently announce a $20 billion, five-year 
comprehensive investment to help its employees 
while supporting job and local economic growth  
in the United States. 

JPMorgan Chase plans to build up to 400 Chase 
branches in 15-20 new markets and hire up to 
4,000 additional employees over the next five 
years. These employees will support our branch 
growth and more lending to small businesses and 
homeowners. Today, Chase has roughly 5,100 
branches across 23 U.S. states, and, for a long time, 
we have wanted to expand beyond our current foot-
print. The heart of our company is our branches. 
We serve 61 million U.S. households — one out of 
every two U.S. families is a Chase customer. Nearly 
every line of business operates out of our branches 
in some way. We are not in some major markets, 
including Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, 
D.C., but Consumer Banking has started the formal 
application process for national expansion.

As I previously said, when Chase enters a commu-
nity, it enters with the full force of JPMorgan 
Chase behind it. We hire people. We lend to and 
support local businesses. We help customers with 
banking, lending and saving. And our philanthropic 
programs help make these communities stronger. 

Our company has made a significant economic 
impact in all the communities in which we operate, 
and we’re excited to become an even more relevant 
part of many others.

We’re also investing in our employees. We want 
to have the best people, period. We know happy 
customers start with happy employees, and we 
want to be the best place to work everywhere we 
do business. For the second time in two years, 
we’re raising wages for 22,000 employees. For 
employees making between $12 and $16.50 an 
hour, we will raise hourly wages to between $15 
and $18, depending on the local cost of living.

The need for rational, thoughtful, consistent  
tax policy.
The best long-term tax policy should have 
the following attributes:

•  The business tax system should be 

competitive – always – and not be traded 
off against anything else. I would consider 
this table stakes for having a healthy 
economy in the long run. 

•  We should build the infrastructure we 

need. (We should consider this table 
stakes, too.) There are many reports that 
highlight how less expensive it is in the 
long run to have better infrastructure. In 
fact, some studies show it is even more 
expensive to have bad infrastructure.

•  We should have a progressive tax system 

(helping people on the lower end) that 
progressively taxes higher incomes, like 
mine. And, of course, no one wants to 

think about their money being misspent. 
Therefore, it is critical for Washington to 
show the American public that their money 
will be used wisely – and that includes 
canceling or modifying programs that 
don’t work and not using money to pay off 
special interest groups. If we need to raise 
taxes on the more well-off, I would hope the 
more affluent would recognize that they 
will do better if the country does better.

•  The tax policy should be consistent in 

the long term for businesses to maximize 
their productivity and growth.

This is the best way to permanently drive 
growth and become a far wealthier and fairer 
society. There are two things I would do 
immediately to improve income inequality 
and create a much healthier society as 
explained below. 

6.  We should reform and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and invest in the workforce of 

the future.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) 
supplements low- to moderate-income 
working individuals and couples, particularly 
with children. For example, a single mother 
with two children earning $9 an hour (approx-
imately $20,000 a year) could get a tax credit 
of more than $5,000 at year’s end. A single 
male without children (also making approx-
imately $20,000 a year) does not get any 
money for a tax credit under this program. 
Last year, the EITC program cost the United 
States about $65 billion, and 27 million indi-
viduals received the credit. This program has 
lifted an estimated 9 million people above the 
poverty line. (The federal poverty guideline 
is determined by household size. For a four-
person household, the poverty level is $25,100 
or approximately $11 an hour.) 

There are some problems with the EITC. Paid 
as a tax credit at the end of the year, 21% of 
the people who are entitled to it don’t file for 
it – mostly because they don’t know about it. 
Additionally, there is some fraud involved. 

We should convert the EITC into more of a 
negative income payroll tax, which would 
spread the benefit, reduce fraud and get it 
into more people’s hands. (Both Democrats 
and Republicans favor a move like this.) 
We should also dramatically expand the tax 
credit and even make it more available to 
workers without children. 

Of the 150 million Americans working today, 
approximately 21 million earn between $7.25 
an hour (the prevailing federal minimum 
wage) and $10.10 an hour. Approximately 
42% of American workers make less than 
$15 an hour. It is hard to argue that you 
can live on $7-$10 an hour, particularly for 
families (even if two are working in that 
household). Decades ago, workers with very 
limited skills could earn a living wage to 
support themselves and their family. In this 
new highly technical world – where work 
skills are so greatly valued – the “natural” 
wage for unskilled workers may no longer 
lead to a living wage. This is an area that 
deserves more study.

37

II.  PUBLIC POLICYJobs are a wonderful thing. Jobs bring dignity. 
That first job is often the first rung on the 
ladder. People like working, and studies show 
that once people start working, they continue 
working. Jobs and living wages lead to better 
social outcomes – more household formation, 
more marriages and children, and less crime, 
as well as better health and overall well-being. 
As society creates an enormous amount of 
wealth, expanding the EITC would be a very 
productive way to share it. If a large portion 
of the American population cannot earn a 
living wage, then we will create a situation of 
permanent social turmoil. 

 We need to improve work skills and training that 
lead to better jobs — this will help both low- and 
middle-income workers. It is also the cure for 
rapid technological change.
Many high schools and vocational schools do 
not provide the education our students need 
– the ability to graduate and get a decent job. 
We should be ringing the alarm bell, signaling 
that inner city schools are failing our children 
– often minorities and mostly lower income 
students. In many inner city schools, fewer 
than 60% of students graduate, and many of 
those who do are not prepared for employ-
ment. We are creating generations of citi-
zens who never had a chance in this land of 
dreams and equal opportunity. Unfortunately, 
it’s self-perpetuating.

And we all pay the price. According to an 
assessment of math and science scores that 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) conducted in 35 
advanced industrialized countries, the United 
States ranks, on average, #24. Making the 
investment to improve our performance to 
the level of the OECD average would increase 
the U.S. gross domestic product by 1.7% over 
the next 35 years. 

America used to be one of the best at training 
our workforce for good jobs. We know what 
to do to regain that mantle. We need to ensure 
that our high schools, vocational schools, tech-
nical schools and community colleges work 
together with local businesses to properly 
train these students so they can get well-
paying jobs upon graduation; then we need 

38

to make sure proper apprenticeships and 
certifications (including college credits) are 
widely available. These students can continue 
to work or have the opportunity to go back 
to college, if they so choose. Doing this well 
will help the lower skilled and middle-income 
workers in the new world. The best way to 
offset any negatives associated with trade 
or technology is through continued educa-
tion and training so that well-paying jobs are 
replaced with other well-paying jobs. 

We know that technological advancements are 
displacing certain industries. Driverless cars, 
for example, are getting closer to mainstream 
use every day. Technology will bring innova-
tion, but it will also change the employment 
opportunities available to hundreds of thou-
sands – perhaps even millions – of people. We 
have the opportunity, now, to start preparing 
for and addressing potential future job losses. 
Anticipating problems that may arise from 
new technologies – and developing plans 
to responsibly minimize them – should be 
considered the final phase of our R&D process. 

We, as a country, must also change the way 
we think about education. In less mutable 
times, a degree meant that formal learning 
was complete. You had acquired what you 
needed for a successful career in your field. 
A degree in today’s world cannot mean the 
end of your studies. New discoveries, new 
advancements, new technologies and new 
terminology all mean that a degree will not 
carry you as far into the future as it once 
did. We must place a higher premium on 
lifelong learning. Corporations can do a lot to 
encourage and foster such a shift. 

We should celebrate the benefits of technology, 
and we should also prepare for its challenges.
Overall, technology is the greatest thing 
that has ever happened to mankind. It is 
the reason why we enjoy our high living 
standard. It is staggering how our lives have 
changed when compared with 100 years 
ago. We live longer and work less; we are 
healthier and safer; and during that time 
period, billions of people have been pulled 
out of poverty. People legitimately worry 
that technology will eliminate jobs as artifi-
cial intelligence replaces drivers, call center 

II.  PUBLIC POLICY operators, etc. And this is no doubt true. But 
this has actually been happening for a long 
time. For instance, back in 1900, 41% of the 
U.S. workforce made their living in agri-
culture. Today, it is under 2%. This is only 
one example, but our vibrant economy has 
always found a way to adjust to job loss by 
creating new jobs and sometimes changing 
the way we work by reducing work days and 
work hours. 

We know technology has been a great force, 
and for the benefit of mankind, that force 
should be left unleashed. In the event that it 
creates change faster in the future than it has 
in the past – and the economy is unable to 
adjust jobs fast enough – the best protection 
is continual workforce training, education 
and re-education, supplemented by income 
assistance and relocation.

7.  America’s growing fiscal deficit and fixing our entitlement programs.

America’s net debt currently stands at 77% 
of GDP (this is already historically high but 
not unprecedented). You can see in the chart 
below that the debt level continues to get 
worse, but at an accelerated pace over the 
ensuing decades. We have time to fix it, so 
I am not immediately concerned. But this 
problem will not age well, and the sooner we 
start to fix it, the better. If we don’t fix the 
growing deficit situation, it will adjust itself 
and in a way we won’t like.

The chart below also shows the Congres-
sional Budget Office’s estimate of the total 
U.S. debt to GDP, assuming a 2% real GDP 
growth rate. Hopefully, with the right poli-
cies we can grow faster than 2%. We esti-
mate if we got the growth rate even a little 
bit higher (i.e., 2½%), then the debt burden 
gets a little lighter but does not disappear.

II.  PUBLIC POLICYThe real problem with our deficit is the 
uncontrolled growth of our entitlement programs.
We cannot fix problems if we don’t acknowl-
edge them. The extraordinary growth of 
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is 
jeopardizing our fiscal situation. We have to 
attack these issues. I am not going to spend 
a lot of time talking about Social Security. 
I think fixing it is within our grasp – for 
example, by changing the qualification age 
and means testing, among other things. 
When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
astutely put Social Security in place in 1935, 
American citizens would work and pay into 
Social Security until they were 65 years old. 
At that time, when someone retired at age 
65, the average life span after retirement was 
13 years. Today, the average person retires 
at age 62, and the average life span after 
retiring is just under 25 years. 

The core issue underpinning the entitle-
ments problem is healthcare in the United 
States. Here are just a few places where we 
know we can do better:

•  The United States has some of the best 
healthcare in the world, including our 
doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinical 
research. However, we also have some of 
the worst – in terms of some outcomes 
and costs. 

•  Administrative and fraud costs are esti-
mated to be 25% to 40% of total health-
care spend.

•  Chronic disease accounts for 75% of 
spend concentrated on six conditions, 
which, in many cases, are preventable  
or reversible.

JPMorgan Chase, along with our partners 
Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway, recently 
formed a joint venture that we hope will 
help improve the satisfaction of our health-
care services for our employees (that could 
be in terms of costs and outcomes) and 
possibly help inform public policy for the 
country. The effort will start very small, but 
there is much to do, and we are optimistic. 
We will be hiring a strong management 
team to start working on some of these  
critical problems and issues: 

•  Aligning incentives systemwide – the 

United States has the highest costs asso-
ciated with the worst outcomes because 
we’re getting what we incentivize.

•  Studying the extraordinary amount of 

money spent on waste, administration and 
fraud costs.

•  Empowering employees to make better 

choices and have the best options available 
by owning their own healthcare data with 
access to excellent telemedicine options, 
where more consumer-driven health initia-
tives can help.

•  Developing better wellness programs, 

particularly around obesity and smoking 
– they account for approximately 25% of 
chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, stroke, heart 
disease and depression).

•  Determining why costly and special-

ized medicine and pharmaceuticals are 
frequently over- and under-utilized.

•  Examining the extraordinary amount of 

money spent on end-of-life care, often 
unwanted.

While we don’t know the exact fix to this 
problem, we do know the process that will 
help us fix it. We need to form a bipartisan 
group of experts whose direct charge is to fix 
our healthcare system. I am convinced that 
this can be done, and if done properly, it will 
actually improve the outcomes and satisfac-
tion of all American citizens.

To attack these issues, we will be using 
top management, big data, virtual tech-
nology, better customer engagement and the 
improved creation of customer choice (high 
deductibles have barely worked). This effort 
is just beginning, and we intend to start 
small. We will report on our progress in the 
coming years. 

40

II.  PUBLIC POLICY 8.  Why is smart regulation vs. just more regulation so important?

It is absolutely necessary to have proper 
regulation. Often, though, we confuse more 
regulation with good regulation. What is 
really needed is smart regulation. If you 
speak with businesses, large or small, they 
will give a long list of the time, effort and 
documentation it takes to run their business. 
They will show you books of red tape, inef-
ficient, outdated systems and extraordinary 
delays. To start a small business today, you 
need multiple licenses. We have given an 
example of this with infrastructure in terms 
of needing up to 10 years to get a permit 
to build a bridge. Please read the article on 
page 42 written by a very liberal Democratic 
former U.S. senator and presidential candi-
date about what it was like to run a small 
business. The article provides excellent 
advice for all of our legislators and regula-
tors. Unfortunately, he learned these lessons 
only after leaving his career in government. 

The current administration is taking steps to 
reduce unnecessary regulation by insisting 
that congressional rules around cost-benefit 
analysis be properly applied. It is also actively 
trying to put regulators in the right roles with 
the proper authority to use commonsense 
principles to make appropriate changes. 

By some estimates, approximately $2 trillion 
is spent on regulations annually, which is 
about $15,000 per household. While we 
believe much of this money is well spent 
(leading to cleaner water and air, and safer 
highways and hospitals, for example), it is 
hard to imagine that all of it is well spent. 
Decades of continuously expanding and over-
lapping regulation certainly can be stream-
lined and improved. There is little doubt that 
excessive regulation has adversely impacted 
innovation, growth and the formation of 
small businesses. The chart below shows the 
dramatic reduction in the net formation of 
small businesses. It is hard to know exactly

why this is happening, but the main culprits 
are probably the cost and difficulties that 
unnecessary regulations cause, coupled with 
the lack of access to credit for new businesses.

Another study examines the effect poor 
infrastructure has on efficiency (for example, 
poorly constructed highways, congested 

airports with antiquated air traffic control 
systems, aging electrical grids and old water 
pipes). This could all be costing us more than 
$200 billion a year. Philip Howard, who does 
some of the best academic work on Ameri-
ca’s infrastructure, estimates it would cost  
$4 trillion to fix our aging infrastructure – 
and this is less than it would cost not to fix it.

9.  Public company corporate governance — how would you change it? And the case against 

earnings guidance.

Last year, I wrote about the decline in 
the number of public companies in the 
United States. Unfortunately, that trend has 
continued unabated. Indeed, if anything, 
it’s accelerated. According to one study, the 
number of U.S. public companies has fallen 
by approximately 50% over two decades 
(from 8,090 in 1996 to 4,331 in 2016). And 
that decline, it pains me to say, is a uniquely 
American phenomenon. Public company 
listings in other developed markets have 
increased over the same period.

Fortunately, policymakers are sitting up and 
taking notice. In a report issued in October 
2017, the U.S. Treasury Department decried the 
decline in the number of U.S. public compa-
nies and recommended several measures to 
stem the tide. Eliminating duplicative regu-
lations, liberalizing restrictions on pre-initial 
public offering communications and removing 
non-material disclosure requirements 
were some of these measures. Jay Clayton, 
Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, also has been quite vocal about 
the decline: He says it potentially deprives 
“Mr. and Ms. 401(k)” of the opportunity to 
participate in much of our country’s wealthy 
creation. I share Chairman Clayton’s concern. 

Too many private company owners look at 
the burdens tied to public company status – 
among them, frivolous shareholder litigation, 
burdensome disclosures that don’t get to 
the core of investor concerns, an unhealthy 
focus on short-term results and shareholder 
meetings that often focus on the trivial. 
Because of such factors, many private compa-
nies make a rational decision to stay private, 

particularly given rules that increasingly 
allow individuals to invest in private compa-
nies. Ultimately, that’s not good for America 
because public companies are a powerful 
economic engine for job and wealth creation. 
They are also responsible for one-third of 
all private sector employment, with millions 
of American families depending on public 
companies for retirement, savings for college 
and home purchases, and investment. 

So what can public companies do about 
these issues? For one, they can continue 
to engage policymakers. Second, they can 
continue to resist pressures to focus on 
the short term at the expense of long-term 
strategy, growth and sustainable perfor-
mance. And in my mind, quarterly and 
annual earnings per share guidance is a 
major contributor to that short-term focus. 
It can cause companies to hold back on tech-
nology spending, marketing expenditures 
and other investments in their future in 
order to meet a prognostication affected by 
factors outside the company’s control, such 
as fluctuations in commodity prices, stock 
market volatility and even the weather. 
That’s why during my time as JPMorgan 
Chase’s CEO we’ve never provided quarterly 
or annual net earnings guidance and why we 
would support any company that considers 
dropping such guidance in the future. We 
totally support being open and transparent 
about our financial and operational numbers 
with our shareholders – this includes 
providing guidance or expectations around 
number of branches, likely expense levels, 
“what ifs” and other specific items. 

43

II.  PUBLIC POLICYWith their own sizable investment portfolios, 
most public companies could use their power 
as shareholders to urge public companies 
and asset managers to take a relentlessly 
long-term focus. 

Of course, shareholders of all stripes – and 
particularly institutional shareholders (asset 
managers, as well as asset owners) – have 
a critical role to play in public company 
corporate governance. Among other things, 
they should exercise their proxy voting 
rights thoughtfully, using independent 

judgment even where they use proxy advi-
sors to inform their judgment. They should 
actively engage with company boards and 
management, as appropriate, to understand 
the company’s point of view and to convey 
their own. And they should evaluate and 
compensate their portfolio managers in a 
manner that reflects the investment time 
horizon applicable to the portfolio they are 
managing. That may mean using perfor-
mance benchmarks over three-, five- and 
even 10-year periods, in addition to shorter 
period benchmarks.

10.  Global engagement, trade and immigration — America’s role in the world is critical.

Today’s world is as complex and dynamic 
as ever. Things like trade, immigration, 
technology and social media, as well as our 
ability to move capital and purchase goods 
with the click of a button, all are changing 
how we live and how we do business. A 
natural reaction to this disruption might 
be to turn inward, to build walls. Such an 
impulse reflects real and justifiable concerns 
about whether our rush to change has 
outpaced our ability to successfully adapt. At 
this moment of uncertainty, however, U.S. 
global engagement is needed more than ever.

Following the devastation brought on by 
two world wars, the United States and other 
like-minded nations resolved to shape a new 
international order that would ensure a future 
unlike the past. In the succeeding years, 
America led the creation of a system defined 
by the rule of law and supported interna-
tional institutions like the United Nations, the 
World Health Organization and the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). These institu-
tions offered states a way to work out their 
differences around a conference table and 
address pressing economic and social chal-
lenges. Organizations like the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) were formed to 
enable collective action, promote peace and 
deter aggression. Treaties and coalitions were 
forged to limit the spread of nuclear weapons 
and to address threats such as terrorism, 
disease and climate change. America under-
took efforts to promote and spread democratic 

44

values such as free speech and equality while 
standing firm against dictators and strongmen 
who would otherwise insist that “might makes 
right.” There should be no doubt that these 
efforts have made us all more prosperous, 
secure and free.

The world has made incredible strides 
since most of us were born. We have over-
come challenges once thought insurmount-
able. More than a billion people have been 
lifted out of extreme poverty in the last 
two decades. Food security is dramatically 
improving – a major driver of improving 
human health – and the number of under-
nourished people around the world is 
continuing to fall. Vaccines have almost 
entirely eliminated most infectious diseases 
around the globe – polio, smallpox, measles, 
mumps, diphtheria, rubella. Malaria has been 
eradicated in many parts of the world, and 
deaths have declined significantly in Africa 
and Southeast Asia over the last decade. 
These achievements and numerous others 
reinforce the overall positive trend line of 
human history. 

Reversing the interconnectedness built by 
our post-World War II institutions is neither 
desirable nor feasible. As a nation, we cannot 
isolate ourselves any more than we can stem 
the ocean’s tide. The international system 
provides agreed-upon rules of the road – and 
mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves 
as the basis upon which we can insist on 
fairer trade practices from competitors and 
adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the 

II.  PUBLIC POLICY means by which we can continue to improve 
people’s lives and livelihoods. The system, 
built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our 
interests. It should be preserved and defended 
– ideally under strong U.S. leadership. 

Any system created by humans, however, is 
ultimately fallible. Sustaining the current 
order and ensuring its longevity mean 
acknowledging its flaws. We must have an 
honest conversation about its strengths 
and, more important, its weaknesses. Global 
GDP has more than doubled since 2000, 
yet too many people are being left behind 
– shut out of a growing economy’s rewards. 
Nations with a proud history of welcoming 
immigrants – including the United States, a 
nation of immigrants – are engaged in hotly 
contested debates over whether immigration 
is good for one’s country or not. Recognizing 
our extraordinary accomplishments is one 
thing, but we should acknowledge what 
has gotten worse. NATO has become less 
effective, serious issues surround trade and 
the WTO is unprepared to deal with today’s 
issues – and too bureaucratic and slow to fix 
them. The associated loss of faith in govern-
ments and institutions has manifested itself 
in a wave of political disruptions, none more 
surprising than in the United States itself. 
We are increasingly divided and unable to 
work out our disagreements. 

Retreating from the world is not the solu-
tion, nor is burning down the current system 
and starting anew. At the same time, we 
cannot and should not turn a blind eye to 
the real pressures millions of families face 
at the hands of globalization, technolog-
ical advances and other factors. Ultimately, 
governments are charged with addressing 
the types of issues and popular grievances 
that led us to this moment of division and 
distrust. But increasingly, the private sector 
must also play a role. 

Business in total has a huge amount of 
capabilities and knowledge. Business needs 
to work with the government to drive good, 
long-term solutions. But if it is to play a 
helpful role, business must be less paro-
chial about what is good for one’s particular 
company and more helpful about what is 
good for the people of our countries. 

Proper resolution of serious trade issues is good 
for the United States and for the rest of the world.
We have entered a time of uncertainty over 
global trade. President Trump has rejected the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as not being 
in the best interests of the United States and 
is renegotiating the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He has begun 
to demand material changes in our trade 
agreements with many nations and has begun 
to demand that nations reduce their trade 
surpluses with the United States, probably 
most importantly between the United States 
and China, the world’s two largest economies. 

We should acknowledge many of the legitimate 
complaints around trade. Tariffs and non-tariff 
barriers to trade are often not fair; intellectual 
property is frequently stolen; and the rights to 
invest in and own companies in some coun-
tries, in many cases, are not equal. Countries 
commonly subsidize state-owned enterprises. 
When the U.S. administration talks about “free” 
and “fair,” it essentially means the same on all 
counts. This is not what has existed. It is not 
unreasonable for the United States to press 
ahead for more equivalency. 

In last year’s letter, I spoke about NAFTA 
and said that while there are some clear 
problems, an updated agreement should be 
worked out in a way that is fair and bene-
ficial for all parties. The logic to do so is 
completely compelling. 

China is far more complex – and the 
complaints are more legitimate. China has 
realized significant economic and employ-
ment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. 
China was expected to continue on an aggres-
sive path of opening up its economy, but this 
has happened at a much slower pace than 
most nations expected. Now, more than 16 
years later, it has the second-largest economy 
in the world and is home to 20% of the 
Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers 
itself a “developing” nation that should not 
be subject to the same WTO standards as the 
United States and other “developed” coun-
tries. The Chinese government is competent 
and capable, and it has done an extraordi-
narily good job of managing its emergence as 
the world’s second-largest economy. I believe

II.  PUBLIC POLICY•  We need to have – and believe that we 
have – proper border control. American 
citizens have the right to complain that 
we have not successfully protected our 
borders since the last immigration reform 
in 1986. In the 1986 amnesty, 3 million 
undocumented immigrants came forward, 
and now we estimate there are another 11 
million undocumented people domiciled 
in our country. If the American public 
does not believe we have proper border 
control, nothing else can be accomplished. 

•  The “Dreamers” who came to America as 
undocumented children (there are approx-
imately 2 million of them) should get a 
path to legal status and citizenship. 

•  We need improved merit-based immigra-

tion. Those who get an advanced degree in 
the United States should receive a green 
card along with their diploma. We need 
these skilled individuals in America. We 
could also improve on other merit-based 
immigration practices.

•  Law-abiding, hardworking undocumented 

immigrants should have a path to legal 
status or citizenship. The American public 
should know this is no easy path. Back 
taxes should be paid, and citizenship could 
take up to 15 years.

•  Finally, it is unlikely the American public 
will feel comfortable with immigration if we 
don’t revert to some core principles. Immi-
grants should be coming here because 
they want to be part of our country and 
who we are as a people. America was an 
idea borne of freedom, with freedom of 
speech, freedom of religion, freedom of 
enterprise, and equality and opportunity. 
People immigrating to this country should 
be taught American history, our language 
and our principles. The American public 
will not be pro-immigration if we don’t 
address these issues.

that China understands most of these issues 
and wants to properly resolve them. Recently, 
the United States threatened unilateral action 
against China. Of course, anything that starts 
to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncer-
tainty to the global economic system. One of 
the administration’s best arguments is that 
negotiation alone has not worked. But regard-
less of the process, here is my view on what 
the best outcomes would look like:

•  The United States should define very clearly, 

and in detail, what it wants from China.

•  The United States should lay out a distinct 
timeline – and determine what the reaction 
would be if it is not met.

•  The United States should listen closely to 
China about any legitimate complaints it 
may have.

•  This should be done in partnership with our 
largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. 

•  The United States should revisit the 

Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts 
considered unfair. The TPP could be an 
excellent economic and strategic agreement 
between America and its allies, particularly 
Asia. This is not against China: The country 
could at some point be offered the oppor-
tunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates 
a willingness to meet its standards, which 
would improve upon the rules-based global 
trading system under American leadership.

While the chance of having an improved trade 
deal with both Mexico and Canada, as well 
as a more mutually beneficial relationship 
with China, is possible and preferable, there 
is always a chance that miscalculations on the 
part of the various actors could lead to nega-
tive outcomes. This obviously creates higher 
risk and more uncertainty until resolved.

We need to resolve immigration — it is tearing 
apart our body politic and damaging our economy.
Immigration reform is important both 
morally and economically. Immigration has 
been a critical part of America’s economic 
and cultural vitality. And there are some 
basic and key principles that most Americans 
seem to agree with:

II.  PUBLIC POLICY Closing policy thoughts.
It is an absolute necessity that America 
maintain a world-class economy, with world-
class companies and a world-class military. 
We need to do a significantly better job of 
managing our economy if we want it to be 
world class. 

And, finally, ceding America’s leadership role 
on the world stage is a bad idea for everyone 
– inside and outside our great land. We must 
all collaborate and respect each other to 
make the world a better place.

IN CLOSING

We are devoted to earning the trust and respect of  

our shareholders, customers, employees  

and the communities we serve every single day.  

We will never lose sight of this.  

And we have an outstanding management team  

leading this mission – a group of dedicated executives 

with exceptional capabilities, character,  

experience and wisdom. 

I am humbled and honored to work at this  
company and with its great people. It is an  
extraordinary privilege and responsibility.  

On behalf of JPMorgan Chase and our management 

team, I want to express my deepest gratitude  

to all of our people – I am proud to be their partner.
